This squeal is due to various reasons, but it is believed to be due primarily to the vibration of the shoes against the discs and the pins or supports on which the shoes rest. Various means have been employed to inhibit this squealing noise. For example, a glue or pad has been applied to the shoes to provide a resilient dampener between the shoes and the backing fingers of the caliper. Another method includes the use of metal springs between the shoes and the backing fingers of the caliper to keep the shoes away from the fingers. Even metal linings have been attached to the shoes on the backside thereof to inhibit the squealing noise. The present invention relates to novel apparatus for reducing the squeal of disc brakes when applied at relatively low speeds and to a method of manufacturing such apparatus.(4) BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) Briefly, this invention comprises a dampener that could be attached to a brake shoe backing plate and a method of manufacturing such dampener and brake shoe backing plate.(6) One of the primary objects of the invention is to provide means for reducing undesirable squealing noises associated with a caliper-type disc brake and a method of making such means for reducing such squealing noises.(7) Another object of this invention is to provide a dampening device which reduces the vibrations of a brake shoe of a caliper-type disc brake device.(8) A further object of this invention is to provide a dampening device which includes a resiliently mounted mass for reducing the vibrations of a disc brake shoe and backing plate associated therewith.(9) Still another object of this invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a dampening device and brake shoe.(10) A further object of this invention is to provide an anti-squealing device which is economical is construction and efficient in operation.(11) Other objects and advantages of this invention will be made apparent as the description progresses."}

These engagement devices are normally actuated by hydraulically operated servos which, upon the supply of pressure or the relief of pressure, either cause actuation or deactuation of the respective friction engagement device for effecting speed changes in the transmission. In some cases pressure is applied to only one servo to cause actuation of the friction engagement device associated therewith and thereby effect the speed change. In other cases it is necessary to apply the hydraulic pressure to one servo and relieve the pressure in another servo to actuate one friction device and deactuate another friction device for effecting the speed change.(4) The timing of the supply and relief of the pressure to the servos obviously affects and controls the smoothness of the shift. If pressure is applied to two servos at the same time, one friction engagement device would cause a dragging phenomenon or fight with another friction engagement device. Automatic transmissions are initially designed with hydraulic controls that, for any given throttle opening and engine speed, are designed to cause a rotatable element, such as a drum, to increase or decrease its rate of rotation so that a graph of such rate against time follows a predetermined curve. The manufacturer or designer chooses this curve so that it represents a shift which is generally acceptable to the public, i.e., so that a shift from one speed ratio to another takes place in a predetermined period of time with as little harshness as possible.(5) As the various components of the friction engagement elements wear or if engine performance varies due to changes in altitude or malfunctioning of components, for example, the time in which a shift takes place, and hence the rapidity of the increase or decrease in the speed of rotating elements changes so that a graph of such rate of speed change versus time no longer follows the original predetermined curve. The time for the shift changes therefor vary over a range and may make the actual shift uncomfortable, or in an extreme condition of wear or altitude change, may be of such length that friction engagement members are subject to excessivee wear and may be excessively heated. The present invention obviates many of the objectionable features of the previously known controls for automatic transmissions.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) Briefly, the present invention comprises means for controlling the rate of change of rotation, i.e., acceleration, of various rotatable members of an automatic transmission to maintain uniform shift changes.(8) One of the primary objects of this invention is to provide an automatic transmission in which the shift quality is maintained uniform regardless of the engine size, within engine performance variations or component condition, i.e., the transmission control is adaptive to changes in engine performance or in the condition of the various friction engagement components of the transmission.(9) Another object of the present invention is to provide an automatic transmission in which the fight between two friction engagement devices as one is applied and another is released is minimized, thereby increasing the smoothness of the load transfer between elements.(10) A further object of this invention is to provide a transmission such as described in which altitude changes on the feel of a shift between two speed ratio ranges is minimized.(11) Another obje"}

Other joining techniques, such as swaging or other mechanical locking, may also be used. Any mode which provides a sound bond and which is electrically conductive is satisfactory for forming the joint.(5) A problem which has arisen at these joints or interfaces is the oxidation and corrosion attack thereat which causes partial and sometimes complete separation of the tip from the rest of the electrode body. This in part is due to the corrosive action resulting from the combustion process. The result is a decrease in or loss of the conduction of electricity to the tip and a voltage drop which affects the function of the plug.(6) SUMMARY(7) It is a general object of this invention to provide spark plugs having improved long life.(8) It is a primary object of this invention to provide a different material for the protection of the joint formed between the firing tip and the lower end of the center electrode of a spark plug.(9) It is also an important object of the invention to provide a protective material which is inexpensive.(10) These objects and others are attained by the use of a protective layer of chromium at least over the joint area of the center electrode.

However, it has now also been found desirable to keep the temperature of exhaust gases high once the gases leave the combustion chamber. Current engine cylinder head designs provide a coolant passage around the exhaust outlet passage from the combustion chamber and thus promote heat rejection from the exiting exhaust gases as soon as they leave the combustion chamber.(4) The present invention arises in part through the discovery that heat rejection by the exiting exhaust gases can be controlled and minimized immediately upon exiting the combustion chamber. The present invention accomplishes this by filling the coolant passage around the exhaust outlet passage in the cylinder head with a mixture of uncured epoxy resin and a curing agent, which is allowed to cure into a solid thermal insulator around the exhaust passageway either entirely or around selected portions thereof.

Field of Invention(3) This invention relates to measuring and testing circuits in general and in particular to a circuit responsive to an electrothermal sensor for measuring the rate of flow of a fluid through a swirl flowmeter.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) Prior art swirl flowmeter circuitry is responsive to a thermistor that is self-heated by an electric current. The source of the electric current is usually from a constant current source. As the precessing low pressure vortex, created by swirl means within the swirl meter and upstream from the probe, passes a probe port, a pneumatic blast impinges on the thermistor. This blast or puff of fluid cools the thermistor for a relatively short period of time. After the vortex passes the probe port, the thermistor temperature rises until the next vortex passes the probe port. This periodic cooling causes a cyclic variation in the temperature of the thermistor and is reflected in a periodic change in the thermistor resistance. As the resistance changes, the voltage drop across the thermistor changes and it is this resulting signal by which the precession frequency of vortex is determined. It is known that there is a well-defined relationship between the precession frequency of the vortex and the rate of flow of the fluid.(6) The output voltage from the thermistor is optimized by decreasing the size of the thermistor to maximize the surface to heat capacity ratio; by choosing a thermistor material having a high temperature coefficient of resistance; and by operating the thermistor at as high a current as possible within its thermal limitations. In prior art measuring systems, this results in an output voltage which is on the order of millivolts at the low end of fluid flow range of the meter and on the order of microvolts at the high end of the fluid flow range. Even though the amplitude of the pneumatic blast increases with the rate of flow, its duration decreases and for a given thermistor the temperature change which can be produced by such a short duration cooling blast is necessarily small.(7) This small temperature change of a given thermistor requires complex circuitry to generate a useful voltage signal. In applications such as used in a motor vehicle, shielding and power supply filtering are particularly difficult and the extraction of signal information from thermal noise involves bandpass filters, tracking filters, amplifiers, shaping circuits, automatic gain control circuits and other complex circuit units.(8) SUMMARY OF INVENTION(9) It is, therefore, a principal object of this invention to provide a simple electrical circuit responsive to an electrothermal sensor.(10) It is another object of this invention to provide a circuit that is adaptable to either negative or positive temperature coefficient sensors.(11) It is yet another object of this invention to provide a circuit that is adaptable to many different sensors and will generate a voltage output signal that is on the order of volts and not microvolts.(12) These and other objects will become apparent from the following drawings, detailed description and claims of a vortex swirl flowmeter sensor circuit incorporating a bridge circuit, with the electrothermal sensor in one leg, electrically connected to a source of power controlled by a Darlington amplifier.

This introduction of inert substances, i.e., combusted exhaust gas, into the combustion chamber is believed to lower peak combustion temperatures thereby reducing NO.sub.x formation. An EGR valve is used to control recirculation of the exhaust gas. The valve is typically a vacuum operated valve.(4) Carburetor idle enrichment systems are desirable additions to carburetor fuel control systems for internal combustion engines since they improve engine operation. Such systems provide a richer fuel\/air mixture for a period of time after a cold start.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the invention described in the given context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the invention is to provide a new structure that serves as a windshield washer reservoir while offering superior performance as a battery heat shield, while occupying less space than the current reservoirs and heat shields.","context":"US-4006280-A Battery heat shield and windshield washer reservoir\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) Vehicle windshield washer systems have long been employed and are now generally considered as safety equipment needed by every vehicle. Such washer systems require the use of a substantial quantity of washer fluid which necessitates fairly large size reservoir apparatus.(3) A more recent phenomia is the substantial increase in vehicle underhood temperatures generally associated with exhaust emission control apparatus such as the air pump and catalytic converter. The higher temperatures in turn have had a decided detrimental effect on storage battery life, as generally the vehicle battery is located in the engine compartment immediately adjacent the engine where it is directly exposed to the engine manifold. In the desire to provide longer battery life and improve customer satisfaction, a heat shield is sometimes utilized which is placed around the battery to help prevent excessive battery temperature build-up. The battery shield itself, however, is a relatively large device and it, along with the windshield washer reservoir, take up a substantial amount of underhood space, a location where space is at a premium.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) The principal object of the present invention, in view of the foregoing, is to provide a new structure which will serve as a windshield washer reservoir while offering superior performance as a battery heat shield, and at the same time occupy less space than the reservoirs and heat shield currently employed.(6) Studies have now shown that the internal temperature of a battery and charge voltage impressed on the battery have a great effect on charge current and gas evolution. Test results reveal that as the charge voltage and temperature increase linearly, the charge current and gas evolution increase exponentially.(7) Batteries subjected to prolonged elevated temperature show a thermal effect on the plates which lead to shortened battery life. Thus, batteries operated at 165.degree. F. had only about 70 percent of the life of batteries operated at 100.degree. F. Moreover, corrosion of the positive grid was more pronounced in the batteries tested at 150.degree. F. Batteries tested at 180.degree. F. exhibited deterioration of the negative plate in addition to grid corrosion and had approximately 50 percent of the life of batteries operated at 150.degree. F., or a potential loss of 70% as compared to batteries operated at 100.degree. F.(8) The findings taken from such tests are that battery internal, that is electrolyte temperature should preferably not exceed about 150.degree. F. except for brief periods in order to achieve optimum battery life. Such will reduce the chance for uncontrolled operation and keep maintenance, water addition, and corrosion to a minimum. For example, high electrolyte temperature affects the chemical oxidation rate of the battery, with the rate of oxidation doubling for every 18.degree. F. above 80.degree. F. Likewise, evaporation of water from the sulfuric acid electrolyte solution tends to greatly accelerate the oxidation of internal components of the battery.(9) The unit of this invention combines the functions of battery heat shield and windshield washer reservoir in a single structure which offers superior battery heat protection and a substantial saving in underhood space.(10) The device of this invention is a box-like structure which can be placed over the battery to be protected. Its side walls are preferably slightly spaced from the battery surface and a fluid reservoir chamber is provided in one or more of the structure walls."}
{"question":"What is the method described in the invention for improving the machinability of powder metal steel parts?","groundtruth":"The method described in the invention for improving the machinability of powder metal steel parts involves heating the workpiece to produce an austenitic microstructure, cooling it to a lower temperature range to transform some of the austenite to ferrite, avoiding the formation of carbides, and then rapidly cooling it to a second lower temperature range to transform the remaining austenite to ferrite and pearlite.","context":"US-4018632-A Machinable powder metal parts\n(1) BACKGROUND(2) It is desirable from a cost and savings standpoint to replace the use of wrought steel machined parts e.g. axle drive gears for example, with machined parts made from powder metal steel. Such gears fabricated from powder metal steels have performed satisfactorily when tested for mechanical properties and when used in automobiles. Moreover, instead of using 16 pounds of wrought steel to make the 8 pound drive gear blank only 10 pounds of powder metal steel is required. Similar material savings are available for other parts as well.(3) Unfortunately, the same steel composition used in wrought steel parts cannot be directly substituted for use in powder metal steel parts due to oxidation problems which occur during the manufacture of the powder metal article. Therefore, a suitable steel powder metal composition must be selected which provides comparable mechanical properties but which is not prone to excessive oxidation during the manufacturing steps of the article. The most suitable compositions are ironmolybdenum alloys of a low Mn content of about 0.9% or less (% refers to percent by weight throughout). Parts are made from such alloy powders which have been mixed with carbon in the form of graphite particles and a suitable compacting lubricant. A preferred composition for powder metal ring gears comprises 0.3 to 0.5% MO, about 0.25% C, about 0.2-0.6% Mn, balance substantially iron.(4) As previously stated, gears fabricated from such powder metal steel perform satisfactorily when tested for mechanical properties and when used in automobiles. However, a problem has been encountered in machining these parts from a high volume, mass production standpoint. For example, when machining standard forged wrought steel gear blanks it is possible to produce about 400 gears before any machine tool changes are required due to wear. On the other hand, when machining powder metal blanks made by current practices, it has been possible to produce only about 50 gears before making machine tool changes. Such poor machinability has made it uneconomical to substitute the use of powder metal steel parts for forged wrought steel parts in mass production situations where machining is necessary to the final part.(5) In studying the machinability problem in the context of such powder metal compositions it was concluded that the poor machinability of such powder metal steel parts could be attributed to undesirable microstructures produced by the standard heat treatment procedures in preparing the parts. By analyzing the microstructures of such parts it was discovered that standard heat treatment procedures produced undesirable coarse carbides mixed with the desirable pearlite type of carbides in the ferrite matrix of the powder metal steel part. It was thus recognized that a new heat treatment was required for powder metal steel parts which would avoid the formation of the coarse carbides and favor ferrite-pearlite formation. Such a method is provided by this invention.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) In its general aspects the invention is a method which comprises the steps of heating a powder metal workpiece or part to a temperature at which an austenitic microstructure is produced and then cooling the part to a lower first temperature range in which transformation of some of the austenite to ferrite occurs. It is critical at this point to avoid the formation of carbides and the cooling temperature must be so selected. The remaining austenite becomes carbon enriched. The part is then rapidly cooled to a lower second temperature range in which the remaining austenite transforms to additional ferrite and to pearlite. The material in the part, when transformation is complete, consists of equiaxed ferrite and pearlite a desirable structure for machining."}

Basically, this is accomplished by allowing a controlled amount of hot exhaust as to recirculate and dilute the incoming fuel and air mixture. Typically, the EGR valve is a vacuum-actuated, poppet-type unit used to modulate exhaust gas flow from the exhaust gas crossover into the incoming air-fuel mixture. A common criticism of EGR systems in automobile engines is that driveability of the automobile is impaired under certain conditions and that fuel economy is significantly downgraded. Also, EGR systems are often complicated requiring extra components which add to the cost of the system and the complexity of the engine compartment. For example, where a high rate spring is used in the EGR valve it becomes necessary to use a vacuum amplifier unit for delivering the necessary amount of vacuum to overcome the high spring rate when the EGR valve is modulated.(4) The present invention is directed to a novel EGR control system which in certain respects reduces the amount of complexity otherwise required. According to the invention, a plurality of individual engine operational characteristics are monitored and utilized in determining when engine exhaust gas is to be recirculated. Broadly, in one aspect, the invention may be considered as providing an on-off (or \"bang-bang\" ) type of EGR system because the individual control signals developed from the monitored engine operational characteristics are utilized to either open or close a valve which is connected in a vacuum line between carburetor venturi vacuum tap and an EGR valve. In another aspect, the invention provides that the individual control signals are utilized in controlling exhaust gas recirculation such that all the control signals must be commanding exhaust gas recirculation for any exhaust gas recirculation to occur. Stated conversely, the control is such that if any one of the control signals is commanding no exhaust gas recirculation, then that signal overrides any other signals to the contrary so that no exhaust gas circulation occurs at all. A further aspect of the invention relates to the specific monitored engine operational characteristics which are utilized in controlling exhaust gas recirculation.(5) In a preferred embodiment of the present invention as hereinafter disclosed, a normally closed, solenoid-actuated valve is disposed in a vacuum line connecting carburetor venturi vaccum to an inlet control port of an EGR valve. Energization of the solenoid-actuated valve is controlled via an electrical control circuit which monitors a plurality of engine operational characteristics. These operational characteristics are: the amount of throttle blade opening; the magnitude of intake manifold vacuum; the relative durations of engine idle and non-idle operation during an immediately past time period; and the engine temperature. The electrical control circuit is so designed that all monitored characteristics must be commanding exhaust gas recirculation for the solenoid-actuated valve to be open. Thus, with this arrangement the EGR valve can be modulated by carburetor venturi vacuum only under a selected set of operating conditions; exhaust gas recirculation is terminated if any one or more of the monitored characteristics dictates that no exhaust gas is to be recirculated, whereby that characteristic effectively overrides any others which are to the contrary.

The assembly is thus rotatable as a unit and the rim which may be located at either the center hub or outer periphery of the matrix readily takes the driving load.(2) Suitable baffles and seals direct comparatively cool high pressure inlet combustion supporting air axially in one direction through the rotating regenerator at one location to preheat the inlet air. Fuel is burned in a pre-heated inlet air and the resulting hot gases are discharged through the turbine stages and then directed in the axially opposite direction at another location through the rotating regenerator to heat the same. An axial temperature gradient is thus maintained across the regenerator during operation.(3) In consequence of the cyclic nature of operation of an automobile gas turbine engine, the juncture between the matrix and rim is subject to severe thermally induced stress in addition to other loads resulting from mechanical and pressure forces during operation. The thin walls of the matrix gas passages respond rapidly to temperature changes, whereas the relatively more massive rim, or peripheral portions of the matrix protected by seals, responds more slowly to temperature changes. At the beginning of a temperature or power cycle, rapid thermal expansion of the matrix crushes the latter against the cooler and slower to expand rim. During the next cooling cycle after the rim has attained its operating temperature and has expanded thermally, the compacted matrix material adjacent the rim contracts and pulls away from the expanded rim, which cools and contracts more slowly.(4) The repeated flexing stresses combined with other forces resulting from the gas pressure differential across the customary seals and the frictional resistance of the seals rubbing against axially opposite ends of the rotating regenerator result in extensive rupture and circumferentially elongated cracks between the matrix and rim especially near the hot axial end surface of the regenerator where the maximum differential thermal expansion and contraction occurs with consequent circumferential leakage of gases across the seals which separate the aforesaid cool high pressure inlet air from the hot and lower pressure exhaust gases. A portion of the inlet gases thus bypass the regenerator and the turbine stages to the extent that the loss in engine efficiency becomes intolerable.(5) Prior attempts to overcome the problem described have only been partially successful with a metal regenerator having a comparatively large coefficient of thermal expansion. In order to achieve regenerator efficiency, the matrix must comprise thin stock, such that even a matrix of expensive stainless steel cannot withstand the forces involved when manufactured in accordance with customary practice. Attempts to use heavier gage material at the peripheral portions of the matrix adjacent the rim merely displace the flexing and rupture to the adjacent thinner gage material.(6) An object of the invention is to provide an improvement in the concept of a gas turbine regenerator of the type illustrated in U.S. Pat. No. 3,534,807 having a sliding juncture between the matrix and rim to allow thermal expansion and contraction of the periphery of the matrix freely relative to the rim. In such structures, the gas pressure differential across the customary seals, known as cross arm seals and arranged generally diametrically across opposite axial faces of the regenerator, result in extremely large localized cyclic shearing forces between the rim and matrix adjacent opposite ends of the cross arm seals, which in cooperation with the aforesaid thermal and frictional forces rupture the juncture between the matrix and rim.(7) Another obj"}

Such an arrangement, although offering the advantage of very good absorption of vibrations, is on the other hand inconvenient in that it produces steering effects on the rear wheels owing to slight longitudinal displacements of the ends of the cross-member, which displacements are allowed by the resilient interconnecting members between the said cross-member and the said frame. Now such displacements are detrimental to the road holding qualities of the vehicle.(3) The invention allows the above-mentioned difficulties to be obviated by using a rear-end suspension of the type comprising a rigid cross-member mounted by means of resilient bearing assemblies on the vehicle frame or body, two substantially V-shaped wheel arms pivoted at two free ends to the cross-member, the vertex carrying the spindle for the wheel, and shock-absorbing and suspension means being provided between the said arms and the vehicle frame or body, the said suspension being characterized, according to the invention, in that the said cross-member is mounted at each of its ends on a support which is secured to the vehicle frame or body, through the medium of directional resilient bearing assemblies arranged at either side of the cross-member, allowing very slight movements or plays about an axis, the said axes of the said bearing assemblies being so directed as to mutually intersect substantially on the axis of the cross-member. Thus, the longitudinal displacements of the ends of the cross-member are prevented during operation, since the device just described produces a wedging effect tending to block or hinder the rotation of the cross-member in the horizontal plane whatever the direction of the efforts applied to the cross-member in that plane. Under such conditions, the resilient suspension of the cross-member absorbs the vibrations satisfactorily without introducing any unfavorable effects interfering with the road holding qualities of the vehicle."}

These governors normally include a stem or rod extending from the movable valve through a hole extending diametrically through a shaft, such as the transmission output shaft. One or more weights are connected to the other end of the stem or rod on the opposite side of the output shaft. These weights aid in controlling the governor pressure-speed curve characteristics of the governor. Since a hole is made diametrically through the output shaft of the transmission, stress concentrations which are not advantageous may be formed in the shaft. In order to avoid the stress concentrations in the shaft, one-sided governors, i.e., governors adapted to be mounted on one side only of an output shaft, have been developed, and the present invention relates to such a governor.(4) The governors are of a non-linear-type in which the governor pressure is a function of the square of the revolutions per minute of the transmission output shaft. The governor pressure-speed curve of such governors is parabolic. Normally, the curve is improved by bottoming out governor weights at one or more midspeed points to piece together two or more parabolic curves, thereby lowering the slope of the total curve and providing a more proportional governor pressure-speed relationship.(5) BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) Briefly, this invention comprises a body adapted to be mounted on one side of a rotatable member, the body having two valves therein for opening and closing at different times under the influence of centrifugal force to produce a hydraulic pressure related to the speed of rotation of the member, and a relay valve for relaying such pressure to an outlet.(7) One of the primary objects of this invention is to provide a hydraulic governor having one speed responsive control portion adapted to be mounted on one side of a rotatable member, such as a transmission output shaft, thereby avoiding stress concentrations in the output shaft.(8) Another object of the present invention is to provide a hydraulic governor of the type described which includes a relay valve having an input pressure of one value and a speed responsive governor pressure on the output side thereof.(9) A further object of the invention is to provide a hydraulic governor such as described, having a speed responsive control portion which may be readily attached to a carrier or support mounted on the rotatable shaft.(10) Still a further object of this invention is to provide a hydraulic governor of the class described which is simple and economical in construction and effective in operation.(11) Other objects and advantages of the invention will be made apparent as the description progresses."}

The present invention relates to improvements in such a seal that may be readily installed in sealing engagement with the tube and tank and that is highly resistant to leakage in the event of deformation of the tank or tube or relative displacement resulting from collision, such as a rear end collision when the fill opening is at the rear of the tank.(3) Another object is to provide such a seal comprising a resiliently deformable material arranged coaxially around the tube and having two cooperating pairs of sealing areas in fluid sealing engagement with the tank and tube.(4) One pair of the sealing areas comprises an annular body portion of the deformable material having its radially inner and outer circumferential portions deformed and clamped respectively between the tube and the portions of the tank around said opening to effect the seal. The diameter of the inner circumferential portion of the body in its undeformed condition is less than the outer diameter of the tube. The diameter of the outer circumferential portion in the undeformed condition is greater than the diameter of the tank opening and defines the base of a radially outwardly opening annular groove coaxial with the body and having said portions of the tank around its opening confined therein. Thus the radially inner and outer annular portions of the deformable body are resiliently deformed and pressed toward each other between the tube and tank to effect the seal.(5) The aforesaid annular groove is defined by axially spaced interior and exterior sides, the interior side extending radially outwardly beyond the exterior side and being inclined toward the latter in the undeformed condition to effect an annular radial seal having an interference fit with the interior wall of the tank around said opening. Also extending into the tank around the tube from the radial seal is a tubular seal of endwise decreasing diameter in the undeformed condition less than the external diameter of said tube to effect an interference fit and sealing engagement therewith. The tubular and radial seals comprise the second pair of sealing areas and are sufficiently thin and flexible to yield readily against said tube and interior wall of the tank respectively when subject to the fluid pressure in the tank, thereby to increase the sealing engagement as the fluid pressure increases.(6) Other objects are to provide such a seal having an annular liquid fuel entrapping channel located axially outward of said groove, and to provide such a seal in combination with a filler tube that extends generally from rear to front through the tank opening and being thereby freely slidable axially or from rear to front through the seal without rupturing the latter in the event of a light to moderate rear end collision."}

The Chrysler Electronic Lean Burn system has been able to achieve compliance with Federal emission standards without the use of other emission control devices such as catalytic convertors, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), air pumps, and like devices, and in so doing, has attained a modest but significant improvement in fuel economy.(4) The present invention is concerned in one respect with an improvement in the Chrysler Electronic Lean Burn system. One benefit of the invention is that the number of discrete electronic circuit components is dramatically reduced. This means that economy in assembly and parts costs is realized and reliability of the system is promoted. Moreover, the circuitry may be more compactly packaged which is important where the engine controls are mounted in the limited space of the engine compartment of a vehicle.

An example of a circuit for generating these two signals is disclosed and claimed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 388,673 filed Aug. 15, 1973 now U.S. Pat. No. 3,885,534, and assigned to the same assignee as the present application. In that application, there is disclosed an integrator circuit which is periodically reset at predetermined engine crank angles to thereby develop a sawtooth waveform representative of engine crank angle and at a frequency representative of the speed of the engine. There is further disclosed in that application a comparator circuit and an adjustable current source which are connected with the integrator circuit in a closed feedback loop to cause the peak value of the integrator sawtooth waveform to be regulated to a desired magnitude over a range of engine speeds. The operation of this circuit may be briefly summarized by saying that the comparator circuit compares the peak value of the integrator sawtooth just prior to resetting thereof against a reference signal and in accordance with the result of the comparison causes the adjustable current source to supply current calculated to cause the peak of the sawtooth to be regulated to a fixed magnitude over a range of engine operating speeds. In this way, the magnitude of the sawtooth at any given instant of time accurately reflects the correct engine crank angle. Current from the adjustable current source is passed through a resistor to develop an analog voltage signal representative of the speed of the engine.(4) One feature of the present invention is that both a sawtooth engine crank angle signal and an analog engine speed signal can be developed by using only two operational amplifiers in conjunction with a small number of passive circuit components. This is important in simplifying construction of this type of circuit for production application. Another feature of the present invention is the provision of an adjustable calibrating resistor in the integrator circuit which enables the magnitude of the analog engine speed signal to be more accurately related to the actual engine speed as established by the frequency of the sawtooth signal. Additional features, advantages, and benefits of the invention along with those already enumerated, will be seen in the ensuing description and claims which are to be taken in conjunction with accompanying drawing."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the test assembly described in the invention?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the test assembly is to determine whether operating parameters of a lubrication pump installed in an engine are at acceptable levels.","context":"US-4125014-A Engine oil pump test assembly\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) 1. Field of the Invention(3) The invention relates generally to valves and more particularly to valves installed for diagnosing failures in engine lubrication systems.(4) 2. Description of the Prior Art(5) In internal combustion engines, particularly of the type employed in land vehicular propulsion, it has become customary to monitor the pressure of the engine lubrication system and to inform the engine operator of the monitored pressure or of a reduction in pressure below a predetermined minimum valve. This communication to the operator is, of course, intended to prevent unlubricated engine operation. Certain problems have been noted, however, in servicing engines or vehicles in which an indication of insufficient pressure has been noted. These relate to the fact that the sensing of reduced system pressure is indicative of more than one mode of failure in the lubrication system, some of which may be major failures such as failure of the engine oil pump itself, or failure, or impending failure of engine bearings. It may, however, merely indicate failure of the pressure monitoring portion of the system, a relatively minor failure. Since diagnosis of lubrication system failures has customarily been effected by removal and replacement of possibly causative components until the low pressure indication has been eliminated, there has been a danger of overlooking impending bearing failure and\/or removal and replacement of non-deflective components such as engine lubrication pumps. This is an expensive, time consuming, undesirable occurrence which is brought about by the inability of service personnel to safely and effectively test an engine driven lubrication pump in its assembled operating condition. This inability arises from the fact that to check one of the prime failure indicia of the pump, its volumetric efficiency, in a simple, effective manner, it is necessary to block the pump outlet and check its capacity to build pressure to a desired level. No provisions are made to affect this blockage in engine installations, and, furthermore, blockage of excessive duration will result in damage to an engine operating without lubricating oil being supplied.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) It is accordingly an object of the present invention to provide a test assembly for determining whether operating parameters of a lubrication pump installed in an engine are at acceptable levels.(8) It is another object to provide a test assembly which prevents damage to the engine during testing of its pump.(9) It is a further object to provide a test assembly operative to block flow from the engine mounted pump and to determine the pump outlet pressure to determine whether the volumetric efficiency of the pump is above a predetermined level.(10) It is a still further object to provide a test assembly operative to limit the duration of operation when flow from the pump is blocked to insure safe operation of the engine.(11) According to one feature of the invention means are provided to conduct fluid from an engine mounted pump externally to a fluid test assembly for monitoring operating parameters of the pump.(12) According to another feature, safety means are provided with the fluid test assembly for preventing damage to the engine through stoppage of fluid flow thereto.(13) According to a further feature the test assembly includes valve means selectively operable to block or permit flow from the pump to permit determination of the volumetric efficiency of the pump.(14) According to a still further feature other valve means are provided for limiting the duration of pump operation in the flow blocked condition to prevent damage to the engine."}

No. 3,978,833, dated Sept. 7, 1976, and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, there is disclosed a circuit for providing a programmed engine control function signal which is specifically disclosed as a programmed vacuum advance signal. This programmed vacuum advance signal is developed from engine manifold vacuum and from an accumulation function which is representative of the duration for which the engine has been operating in selected operating modes. Within its control range between maximum and minimum limits of vacuum spark advance, the programmed vacuum advance signal is developed as a function of the product of these two variables, namely (1) instantaneous engine manifold vacuum, as monitored by a vacuum transducer and associated transducer circuit, and (2) the accumulation function which increases in magnitude as a function of time when the engine is in a non-idle operating condition and which decreases in magnitude as a function of time when the engine is operating at idle condition. The vacuum transducer and associated transducer circuit disclosed in that patent develop a constant frequency rectangular waveform wherein the pulse width of the pulses comprising the waveform is representative of engine manifold vacuum. However, the relationship is such that at zero manifold vacuum the pulses have a definite non-zero pulse width. Thus, the product of the pulse width of the rectangular waveform signal by the accumulation function would yield an incorrect result where it is desired to obtain the product of manifold vacuum by the accumulation function. In order to obtain the correct product of manifold vacuum and accumulation function signal, it becomes necessary to make allowance for the non-zero width of the pulses which exists at zero manifold vacuum. Accordingly, a special circuit which makes this allowance is provided in that patent.(4) The present invention is concerned with an improvement upon the scheme disclosed in the foregoing patent. The advantages of the improvement afforded by the present invention are as follows.(5) The gain of the output amplifier is much easier to set. The previous system uses a more complex vacuum amplifier requireing proper choice of four interactive resistors. It is often difficult to find four appropriate resistors among standard values in order to achieve a desired gain while staying within impedance limits imposed by the system. With the present invention, development of engine control systems can be speeded up as systems can now be provided with a variable gain adjusted by a potentiometer. This capability was not available in the previous system as simultaneous adjustment of four interacting resistors was not practical. Additional advantages of the invention will be seen as the description proceeds."}
{"question":"What is the invention described in the patent?","groundtruth":"The invention described in the patent is a reservoir for a master cylinder for the hydraulic brakes of a motor vehicle.","context":"US-4127210-A Master cylinder reservoir\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) This invention relates to improvements in brakes, and more particularly to a reservoir for a master cylinder for the hydraulic brakes of a motor vehicle.(3) One type of master cylinder system and the type to which this invention relates is commonly referred to as a split system or tandem master cylinder system. A master cylinder in such a system has a reservoir above it to provide the additional fluid needed as the brake shoes wear, for example, and has distinct and separate connections to two sets of brakes, such as to the rear wheel brakes and the front wheel brakes, or to two sets of brakes each set of which includes one front wheel brake and one diagonally located rear wheel brake. The reservoir is conventionally divided into two chambers, one for the primary piston chamber (for one set of brakes) and one for the secondary piston-chamber (for the other set of brakes). If one set of brakes malfunctions in such a way that a drop in hydraulic pressure occurs in such set, the other set will continue to operate.(4) Various types of reservoirs with different partitioning arrangements are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,147,596; 3,194,019; 3,520,136 and 3,731,487. The first three patents show partitions which extend up from the bottom of the reservoir only part way toward the cap or top thereof. These arrangements permit the reservoir to be filled through one inlet as the fluid will eventually flow over the partitions into the other sections of the reservoir. U.S. Pat. No. 3,731,487, shows a partition which, except for a pressure bleed-through passage, completely blocks communication between two sections of a reservoir. In such an arrangement the reservoir cover is completely removed when hydraulic fluid must be added.(5) One of the problems encountered with reservoirs having partial partitions occurs during braking deceleration periods. Under these conditions fluid tends to slosh over the partition due to the build-up of the fluid toward the front of the particular section of reservoir. For example, during a one G deceleration, the surface of fluid in a reservoir section will extend at a 45.degree. angle and fluid will tend to flow from the rearward section to the forward section. If the rear brake system should develop a leak, for example, the supply of fluid in the front reservoir sections, from which fluid is supplied to such systems would gradually be depleted. During each braking operation, the fluid from the rear reservoir section, would flow over the partition into the front section. Thus, not only would the rear brakes eventually be rendered ineffective due to the loss of fluid from the rear brake system, but the front brakes would eventually be rendered ineffective due to the depletion of fluid in the rear reservoir. Similar situations could be presented under acceleration conditions, during cornering manuevers and with vehicle vibration. Obviously, such situations are not desirable.(6) A copending coassigned application, Ser. No. 778,893 filed on Mar. 18, 1977, claims a reservoir adapted to overcome many of the shortcomings of reservoirs of the type described above.

The distributor also features a one piece distributor rotor unit comprising a thin insulate disc member, which is readily detachably received on one end of the engine driven rotor shaft and carries a rotor distributor blade on one side thereof, and a ferrous metallic, rigid stiffener or reinforcement plate, which is molded in and carried on the other side of the rotor disc. The stiffener plate has a number of integrally formed, circumferentially spaced interrupter vanes depending therefrom into the space between the magnet and Hall Sensor element of the pickup structure of which the Hall Sensor element is disposed radially outwardly of the magnet and the interrupter vanes. The stiffener plate further includes an integrally formed grounding tab connection, which contacts the steel rotor shaft of the distributor when the rotor unit is mounted in place on the end of the rotor shaft, so that the interrupter vanes and the stiffener plate can be electrically grounded through the rotor shaft to divert any arc flashover, which may occur within the distributor cap, away from the pickup structure and to conduct it instead, through the grounded interrupter vanes and rotor shaft, thereby to protect the pickup structure and electronic circuitry within the distributor against damage from such arcing.("}

Field of Invention(3) The present invention relates to fuel filler tube assemblies for vehicular mounted fuel tanks.(4) 2. Description of the Prior Art(5) Fuel filler tube assemblies currently in widespread use by the automotive industry generally consist of a large number of parts, usually fabricated from ferrous metals. A fuel delivery tube is secured to the fuel tank and extends to a position proximate a wall of the vehicle body. The tube is formed with a sheet metal baffle plate dividing it into upper and lower sections to provide separate liquid and vapor paths from the tank. Because of governmental restrictions on the use of leaded fuels the end of the tube remote from the tank generally terminates in one of many well-known multipiece restrictor assemblies to prevent introduction of substantial quantities of leaded fuel into the tank. The restrictor assembly, in turn, is generally secured as by welding to a relatively rigid mounting flange housing which is attached to a portion of the vehicle body.(6) While the prior art filler tube assemblies described have been functionally adequate, certain disadvantages have been recognized. First, the use of a large number of parts to perform the fuel delivery function is not economically desirable or cost effective. Second, the prevailing use of ferrous parts results in a heavy assembly and leads to requirements for laborious and uneconomical corrosion protection. Finally, the use of rigid fuel tube mounting structures may prove undesirable in certain conditions of inadvertent use which may require withstanding certain mechanical impacts.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) Responsive to the disadvantages of the prior art fuel filler tube assemblies, it is an object of the present invention to provide an assembly that is simple in construction and provides a reduced number of parts formed of light, corrosion resistant materials.(9) It is another object to provide non-rigid means for mounting the assembly.(10) These objects are achieved in a simple structure in which a housing and a tube are joined in compressive sealing engagement."}

The subject application relates to the specific structure and resultant characteristics of a particular improved seal ring for such an articulated connection.(3) Articulated connections of the type disclosed herein require a good contact between a sealing member and a seat member. The sealing member and the seat member are subject to relative rotational movement therebetween particularly caused by rolling action of a transversely mounted engine. The sealing member is also subject to a considerable amount of abrasive rubbing. It is desirable that the sealing member have a sufficient resistance to wear over the life of the vehicle engine and exhaust system and the seal should possess good high temperature strength and stability.(4) An object of the invention is to provide an improved articulated connection between an exhaust manifold and an exhaust header or tailpipe which utilizes a sealing annulus of packed or compressed wire construction, the closely extending strands of wire producing a seal with a sufficiently continuous sealing surface characterized by good wearability, high temperature resistance, stability and a slight resiliency for conformation to imperfect geometric surfaces.(5) Another object is to provide an annular seal ring wherein a spherical sealing surface is formed by compressive molding or packing of a number of wires having a relatively small diameter compared to the size of the seal ring and of a material of sufficient hardness and high temperature durability to produce a sufficiently continuous sealing surface for exhaust gases.(6) Other objects and features of this invention will be more readily understood and appreciated after a reading of the following detailed description, reference being had to the accompanying drawings which form a part of the specification and which illustrate preferred embodiments of the invention."}

A fire control system in a battle tank is under the command of the tank gunner and includes an optical system which affords the gunner a limited field of view of the overall combat scene. Disposed in the optical path is a reticle which the gunner must place on a target by manipulation of the gunner's controls. The usual turret-mounted tank gun is under the gunner's control and may be displaced in azimuth and in elevation according to the gunner's elevational and azimuthal commands. In response to these commands, tank gun displacement and corresponding changes in the field of view occur simultaneously. When the reticle has been placed on the target and the range of the target determined, the gun is so aimed by the tank's own system that a hit should occur on the target when the gunner gives the fire command.(4) In order to train tank gunners and to enable them to maintain and improve their skills it is desirable to use a simulator rather than to conduct live training and practice operations in the field. Currently available simulators have a number of disadvantages. Some are very complicated, and hence expensive. Others are very crude and thus lack important capabilities and realism which are beneficial for training and practice purposes. These simulators may also lack versatility.(5) The present invention represents a significant advance in a fire control combat simulator in a number of respects. First, a more realistic display of the field of view is presented. Essentially unlimited versatility in composing the scene which is to be displayed in the field of view is attained. Moving targets, with the capability of evasive maneuvers, can also be displayed. Motion of the firing tank can be reflected in the field of view.(6) Briefly, the preferred disclosed system of the invention employs a plurality of object generators each of which stores the shape of an object which may appear in the overall battle scene. A host computer assigns positions and ranges to these objects relative to the firing tank. The system will display to the gunner those objects which are within the field of view of the gunner's optical system. As the gunner imparts elevational and azimuthal commands by his controls, this information is acted upon by the host computer and transmitted to the object generators on an updated basis. The picture within the field of view is in turn correspondingly updated to reflect the gunner's commands. Another feature includes the storage of object information in each object generator. Rather than storing a dot matrix which would require an enormous amount of storage, the data compression scheme employed in the present invention stores information concerning the outline of the object and its color. There is also a priority feature linking the object generators whereby when more than one object generator is calling for its object to be displayed in the same location on the display only the object which has a higher priority and hence is at a closer range, is displayed during the overlap period.(7) The foregoing, along with additional features, advantages and benefits of the invention, will be seen in the ensuing description and claims which should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings and disclose a preferred embodiment according to the best mode presently contemplated in carrying out the invention."}

No. 798,715 filed May 19, 1977, entitled \"Fuel Circuit for an Internal Combustion Engine.\"(4) Briefly, an electronic fuel metering system of the type disclosed in the co-pending application operates an electric motor driven control pump in such a manner the pump delivers the correct amount of fuel required for operation of the engine. It has been discovered to be advantageous to mount the fuel pump and motor assembly as close as possible to the point at which the fuel is distributed for mixture with air ingested by the engine to form the combustible mixture. In the typical automotive vehicle, this means that the fuel pump and motor assembly should be mounted directly on the engine, for example, within the confines of the usual air filter housing. In order to make such mounting feasible it becomes desirable to make the pump and motor assembly as compact as possible. The present invention in one respect is concerned with providing such a pump and motor assembly. The invention is also directed to an improved assembly which utilizes fewer parts, is more economical, and greatly minimizes the adverse effect of once-per-revolution friction variations on flow variation.(5) Features, advantages and benefits of the invention will be seen in the ensuing description and claims which should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings which illustrate an examplary but presently preferred embodiment according to the best mode presently contemplated in carrying out the invention."}
{"question":"What does this invention relate to?","groundtruth":"This invention relates to an engine hydrocarbon control system for fluidly connecting the crankcase and a hydrocarbon vapor storage container to the engine air induction means.","context":"US-4245592-A Controlled flow purge system and apparatus\n(1) This invention relates to an engine hydrocarbon control system for fluidly connecting the crankcase and a hydrocarbon vapor storage container to the engine air induction means thereby producing a predetermined desired flow rate through the storage container and the crankcase which changes corresponding to changing operating modes of the engine.(2) For the past several years, automobile engines have included means fluidly connected to the engine carburetor to evacuate the crankcase of hydrocarbon vapors and thus withdraw lubricant and fuel vapors therefrom. Commonly, a breather cap device has been provided to permit flow of air into the crankcase. The air then flows through a PCV (positive crankcase ventilation) valve to the carburetor. The PCV is basically a check valve which prevents reverse flow from the carburetor back into the crankcase. This system works well to purge the fuel and lubricant vapors from the engine. However, the addition of supplemental air to the carburetor may have an undesirable effect on engine operation, particularly during engine idling. Often these additional quantities of air added to the manifold are sufficient during an idle mode of operation to adversely affect the engine operation by excessively leaning the air-fuel mixture. Nor is a continuous high flow rate through the crankcase necessary.(3) In addition to the aforementioned PCV system, a hydrocarbon vapor storage canister is commonly provided to temporarily store hydrocarbon vapors emitted from the fuel tank or from the float bowl of a carburetor. The canister interior contains activated carbon having a finite storage capacity. Therefore, it is necessary to periodically purge the canister by drawing air through it. Since an automobile engine operates most often in a cruise mode of operation, a large percentage of the crankcase purging as well as the rejuvenation of the storage canister should occur during this operative mode. Another desirable time to rejuvenate the canister occurs when the vehicle is decelerating. In this deceleration mode, the carburetor throttle plate is in a closed position and consequently manifold vacuum is at a particularly high level. A large flow of air can be pulled through the crankcase and the storage canister during a deceleration mode without adversely affecting engine operation.(4) To control purge flow according to the aforesaid desired conditions, an automatic flow control valve is provided. It substantially prevents flow during a wide open throttle mode of operation and it provides only a modest flow during an idling mode. During these modes, the vehicle requires the most efficient operation of the engine. During cruise and deceleration modes however, the flow through the canister and the crankcase is substantially increased since slight engine inefficiency may be tolerated under these conditions. The flow control valve is located between the outlet of the hydrocarbon vapor storage canister and the engine. A flow opening or orifice is provided within the valve through which portions of a valving member extends. The valving member is normally moved to a closed position by yieldable means such as a coil spring. During wide open throttle operation of the engine, the crankcase vacuum level is at its lowest level and thereby the movable valve member is held in the closed position by the spring. In the closed position, substantially all flow through the crankcase or the canister is prevented. As the engine attains a cruise operational mode the throttle blade of the carburetor moves to a mid-position and the vacuum pressure in the carburetor is communicated to the crankcase and hence to a surface of the valve member. At cruise the vacuum is greater than at WOT and therefore the valving member is moved against the spring so that a small dimensioned contour of the valve member is brought within or across the orifice opening. This facilitates relatively larg"}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the engine crankcase and canister purge system?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the engine crankcase and canister purge system is to provide maximum purge flow during engine deceleration, decreased purge flow during cruise mode, substantially reduced flow during idling, and zero flow during wide open throttle operation.","context":"T and therefore the valving member is moved against the spring so that a small dimensioned contour of the valve member is brought within or across the orifice opening. This facilitates relatively large flow of air therethrough and through the canister. During an idle mode, it is undesirable to permit such a large flow of air to the manifold since this may undesirably change the air-fuel mixture and produce roughness. Therefore, an increased vacuum pressure level associated with an idle mode further moves the valve member against the spring so that a larger dimensioned portion is placed across the opening. This greatly decreases the air flow from and through the canister and to the manifold. The highest vacuum pressure levels are obtained when the engine is decelerating. The high vacuum then moves the valve member further against the spring thereby positioning a small dimensioned portion of the valve in the opening. Resultantly a maximum flow of air passes through the opening and provides maximum purging of the storage canister and crankcase.(5) In view of the previous remarks, it can be understood that continuous purging of the canister may have adverse affects on engine operation under certain operating conditions. Particularly, it is desirable to decrease the purge flow during engine idle and W.O.T. conditions. It is highly desirable to provide for a much greater purge flow under deceleration conditions of the engine when maximum flow is possible without adversely affecting engine operation. Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide an engine crankcase and canister purge system with greatest air flow during the deceleration mode and substantial flow during a cruise mode. The flow is substantially decreased during engine idling mostly blocked at wide open throttle. A further object of the invention is to provide a vapor storage and crankcase purging system which utilizes an automatic air flow control responsive to engine vacuum conditions to provide maximum purge flow under an engine deceleration condition, decreased purge flow during a cruise condition, a substantially reduced flow during idling and substantially zero flow during wide open throttle operation.(6) Other objects and advantages of the invention will be more readily apparent from a reading of the following detailed description of one inventive embodiment, reference being had to the accompanying drawings in which the embodiment is illustrated."}

Field of Invention(3) The present invention relates generally to automotive fuel tank filler tubes and more specifically to restrictor assemblies therefor.(4) 2. Description of the Prior Art(5) With the introduction of catalytic converters for treating the exhaust gases of internal combustion engines, Federal standards were promulgated which were intended to inhibit the filling of fuel tanks of automobiles equipped with such converters with leaded fuel, since use of leaded fuel renders the catalytic converters permanently ineffective. Among these standards is one limiting the amount of leaded fuel that could be delivered to the tank of a converter equipped automobile before the automatic shut-off mechanism of a filling station nozzle actuates to block flow to 700 cubic centimeters of fuel. Another companion standard provides that the delivery nozzles for unleaded fuel shall not exceed 0.85 inch in diameter while delivery nozzles for leaded fuel shall not be less than 0.93 inch in diameter.(6) One automotive industry response to these standards has been to install restrictor assemblies in the fuel filler tube having a spring loaded door closing an aperture sized to permit insertion of only an \"unleaded nozzle\" for opening the door. U.S. Pat. No. 4,034,784 and application Ser. No. 899,685, filed Apr. 24, 1978, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,185,844, assigned to the assignee of the present invention, are exemplary of such assemblies.(7) It has been noted, however, that the economic pressure of the higher cost of unleaded fuel has resulted in the owners of converter equipped automobiles modifying the restrictor assemblies through enlarging the aperture to permit the use of leaded fuels. This, of course, tends to defeat the above mentioned Federal standards.(8) It has been suggested that some reinforcing means, such as a simple washer adjacent the aperture, be employed in the restrictor assemblies to inhibit the enlarging modification; but none yet suggested have been effective.(9) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(10) Responsive to the deficiencies of the prior art restrictor assemblies, it is an object of the present invention to provide a restrictor assembly configured to greatly inhibit modification required to permit insertion of a leaded fuel delivery nozzle.(11) According to a feature of the present invention, a hardened reinforcing member having projections for preventing nozzle insertion is secured to a portion of the restrictor assembly about its nozzle receiving aperture in a manner that tends to require its complete disassembly to effect aperture enlarging modification of the restrictor assembly."}
{"question":"What is the method described in the invention?","groundtruth":"The method described in the invention is electroforming a metallic sleeve about a ceramic cylindrical member.","context":"US-4261092-A Method of electroforming a metallic sleeve and ceramic shaft joint\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) 1. Field of the Invention(3) In one aspect this invention relates to electromagnetic forming of metal parts. In a further aspect, this invention relates to electroforming metal parts about a ceramic cylindrical member. In yet a further aspect this invention relates to ceramic and metal parts joined together.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) In many cases successful applications of ceramic parts to the large scale production runs such as is necessary for automotive and industrial use depend on the use of a cost effective method to join the ceramic part to a metallic part. One example of a metal to ceramic joint which is necessary for utilizing a ceramic part is in a gas turbine or turbocharger structure which requires the attachment of a metallic power shaft to a ceramic rotor. The state of the art can produce a ceramic rotor with a short shaft extending axially from the wheel. However, a metal shaft must be attached to the ceramic portion ot transfer power from the rotor to a drive train.(6) Coupling the metallic shaft to a ceramic turbine wheel has been at best a difficult and costly task. One method employed in the prior art is a mechanical attachment scheme generally known as a curvic coupling. A curvic coupling is a face spine arrangement with curved radial teeth ground or formed into the face of the parts. In a curvic coupling the coupling memebers can transmit torsional force and are free to absorb relative thermal expansion and axial motion between the two materials. However, such a coupling requires exceedingly close dimensional tolerances and interface contract surface treatment; therefore, the coupling is very costly and difficult to make especially where one member is a ceramic. Such a coupling, while useful as an exercise to prove the concept of a ceramic rotor-metallic shaft assembly, does not meet the requirements of being producible in large volumes and the cost of such structures is prohibitive for use in a large scale consumer product.(7) Electromagnetic forming is a method which can be used to join a metal to a ceramic. As such, it appears to offer a solution to the problems of the prior art joining methods. Initial attempts to electromagnetically deform a metal shaft about a cylindrical ceramic shaft have shown that the forces generated when the metal shaft is formed rapidly into contact with the ceramic material cause the ceramic to break. Breakage is particularly pronounced where there is a change in the cross-sectional area of the ceramic or areas where the metal has a sharp edge which contacts the ceramic material during forming. Also, it appears that where the metallic sleeve is not uniformly disposed about the periphery of the ceramic material, the metallic sleeve rapidly coming into contact with the ceramic on on one side but not on the other, causes formation of bending stresses on the ceramic. Such stresses frequently cause cracking during the production of the parts.(8) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(9) The problems of the prior art can be overcome by using the method, fixturing and joint construction of this invention. In practicing the method of this invention, a metallic part to be attached to a ceramic shaft has a sleeve portion disposed about one end of the ceramic shaft. The metal sleeve portion will be axially aligned with the ceramic shaft and surrounds its periphery. At least one damping pad, comprising one or more high damping capacity metallic shock absorbing plates is placed at each end of the longitudinal axis of the ceramic shaft. A compressive preload, corresponding approximately to the expected tensile stresses which will be caused in the ceramic material upon the application of the shock load during forming is applied to the ceramic. Then the electromagnetic forming of the metallic sleeve is carried out in such a manner that the material is firmly engaged with the periphery of the ceramic"}

In an electronic fuel metering system the quantity of fuel to the engine is metered electronically in accordance with certain control parameters. An example of such an electronic fuel metering system is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,935,851, assigned to the same assignee as the present application. A particularly desirable way to introduce the fuel into the engine induction passage is by utilizing one or more fuel spray bars which spray fuel as distinct jets into the induction passage. An example of such fuel spray bars is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,132,204, also assigned to the same assignee as the present application. In this latter patent the throttle body assembly which is used with the disclosed spray bar system has rectangular shaped induction ports with a pair of counter-rotatable throttle blades disposed in each port. Fuel is sprayed centrally of each port toward the opening defined between the juxtaposed edges of the throttle blade pair.(4) There are certain advantages to throttle bodies which incorporate circular induction ports, as opposed to rectangular or other shaped ports. For one, a circular shaped port is generally easier to machine from a rough casting than is a rectangular shaped port. Also, the circular shape is akin to that used in conventional, commercially available carburetors, and hence allows use of more or less conventional butterfly-type throttle blades. Heretofore however, the use of circular port throttle bodies and butterfly type throttle blades in conjunction with an electronic fuel metering system has been considered impractical for the purpose of achieving compliance with mandated governmental regulations relating to vehicle exhaust emissions and fuel economy.(5) The present invention provides a solution which is capable of rendering the use of circular port throttle bodies compatible with an electronic fuel metering system toward achieving compliance with mandated regulations. Thus, the invention means that a fuel mangement system can incorporate the benefits of both of electronic fuel metering technology and more or less conventional carburetor manufacturing technology insofar as the latter relates to manufacturing of the circular ports and blades. The invention requires a minimal number of parts, is of economical manufacture and performs well.(6) According to one aspect of the invention, a deflector mounts on the downstream face of the throttle blade to act much like spoiler in generating turbulence. According to another aspect, a mixing tube downstream of the blade generates additional turbulence. These features, individually and collectively contribute to improved fuel preparation.(7) The foregoing features, advantages and benefits of the invention, along with additional ones, will be seen in the ensuing description and claims which are to be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.

A positive air pressure applied to the L-shaped seal during engine operation keeps the L-seal pressed firmly against the rubbing seal and the housing.(6) This seal represents an advance in the art of sealing means for use with rotary regenerators.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) Briefly, this invention provides a method of forming an L-shaped seal. The process begins by severing a length of flat strip to be formed into an L-shaped seal of the desired configuration. The severed length of flat-strip is positioned so that a longitudinal portion of the strip is rigidly grasped to provide a firm anchor. A second longitudinal portion of the severed strip is unconstrained. After the strip is grasped, the free standing portion is incrementally formed towards a position where the formed second longitudinal portion makes an oblique angle with the clamped first portion. The oblique angle is defined by the line connecting the point of intersection of the two strip portions and the free ends of the strip portion.(9) After formation, the strip is released from the die and further processing can be performed on the strip to insure the finished seal has the desired properties. Generally, when the seal is formed from metal it will be heat treated after forming to develop the desired properties.(10) As an additional feature of the invention, the strip can be formed with a concave face on the formed portion. The concave curve of the deformed portion acts to bias the periphery of the L-seal into contact with the rubbing seal, the resulting seal having essentially a line contact at the outer periphery of the L-seal. Thus, the seal components are in sealing contact with the rotating regenerator while the engine is being started and before air pressure within the regenerator cavity is built up to normal operating pressure."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of a knock detector in a spark-ignited internal combustion engine?","groundtruth":"The purpose of a knock detector in a spark-ignited internal combustion engine is to detect the occurrence of knock.","context":"US-4312214-A Knock detector for internal combustion engine\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) This invention relates to a knock detector for detecting the occurrence of knock in a spark-ignited internal combustion engine.(3) The phenomenon of engine knock has long been known to those familiar with internal combustion engines. Engine knock is outwardly manifested by the occurrence of an audible pinging sound. The severity of the knock is reflected by the intensity and\/or duration of the pinging sound. Automotive internal combustion engines are designed to operate on fuel of a specified minimum fuel octane rating, and in general an occasional light transitory knock is not objectionable in an internal combustion engine in an automobile. Indeed, compression ratios are selected and spark advance schedules are advanced for automotive internal combustion engines for the purposes of maximizing fuel economy to an extent where under transient operating conditions an occasional light knock may occur. However, more intense and\/or more prolonged occurrences of engine knock are definitely undesirable as they have the potential for greatly increasing wear and tear on the engine and even causing major damage to engine-related components. Thus, while an engine may be designed on paper and constructed in the laboratory for knock-free operation, the variables which come into play in actual mass production of a spark-ignited internal combustion engine and in actual use of the engine in an automotive vehicle can give rise to objectionable levels of engine knock. Non-uniformity of gasoline octane, changing ambient conditions, and variations in manufacturing tolerances are among the factors which individually and collectively can adversely affect the engine operation and create knock.(4) If knock does occur, a proven technique for its alleviation involves an appropriate retarding of the spark timing. Unfortunately, this technique is inconsistent with the objective of increasing fuel economy.(5) The advent of electronic engine controls on production automotive vehicles offers the possibility for selectively retarding spark timing in response to the detection of incipient, or borderline, engine knock. For example, current electronic spark advance systems electronically adjust the timing of spark ignition as a function of conventional variables such as engine speed and engine load. By adding a suitable knock detector to such a system knock can be detected at borderline levels and spark timing can be automatically retarded to alleviate the knock and thereafter advanced as otherwise scheduled. This means that the fuel economy and emissions benefits can be obtained while knock and its related problems can be avoided.(6) The present invention in one respect is directed to the provision of such a suitable knock detector.(7) A study of a number of previous patents reveals that in a general way, knock detectors may be divided into two categories. The first category involves those knock detectors which are utilized to grade and\/or blend gasoline. The second category involves those which are employed in actual usage in an automotive engine for over-the-road operation. Examples of patents in the first category are U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,469,954; 3,575,039; and 3,822,538. An example of a patent of the second category is U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,155. Knock detectors in the first category are designed for what basically amounts to a controlled laboratory situation where engine speed may be accurately controlled, where accelerations and decelerations may be slowly, uniformly made, and where fuel octane may be accurately monitored. Such conditions are in marked contrast to the highly dynamic operation of an engine in an automobile where the engine is subject to sudden accelerations and decelerations, a wide range of operational speeds, and where shift points of the transmission coupled to the engine impose sudden extreme transients on the engine, not to mention of c"}
{"question":"What are the challenges in detecting engine knock in an automobile?","groundtruth":"The challenges in detecting engine knock in an automobile include accelerations and decelerations, a wide range of operational speeds, sudden extreme transients on the engine due to shift points of the transmission, nonuniformity in octane ratings of gasolines, and the difficulty of distinguishing knock-induced vibrations from other engine vibrations.","context":"ccelerations and decelerations, a wide range of operational speeds, and where shift points of the transmission coupled to the engine impose sudden extreme transients on the engine, not to mention of course the nonuniformity in octane ratings of gasolines vended at the pump. It is a far easier task to detect engine knock under controlled laboratory conditions than it is in an automobile operating on the road. One problem with previous knock detectors of this first category is that they would appear generally unable to consistently and accurately detect knock if the engine were subjected to the more severe operating conditions to which it would be subjected if in an automobile.(8) The knock detectors falling into the second category operate to retard spark in response to incipient knock, but in general they seem to contain large amounts of electronic circuitry, and for many of these knock detectors, it is questionable whether they can consistently and accurately detect knock under all transient conditions which may be encountered although in general they represent more resourceful approaches than those of the idyllic first category. Furthermore, mass production requirements dictate that such systems be cost effective, reliable, and adaptive.(9) The present invention is directed in a further respect to fulfilling a need for a knock detector suitable for mass production which will reliably detect knock in its incipiency under the myriad of different operating conditions which may be encountered in an automobile engine in over-the-road use and which in conjunction with an electronic spark advance system will operate to retard spark to alleviate the knocking tendency and therafter allow normal spark advance schedules to be resumed for fuel economy and emissions purposes once the knocking as ceased.(10) Investigations of the engine knock phenomenon have demonstrated that for a given engine model knock-induced vibrations will occur at reasonably well-defined frequencies. For example, in a four-stroke reciprocating piston engine the frequencies at which knock occur appear to be functions of the diameters of the engine cylinders to a first order and the displacement to a second order, and it does not appear that they are functions of knock intensity. Thus, sensors for detecting knock may be mounted on the engine and tuned to monitor the frequency bands in which knock vibrations may be expected. The problem, of course, in detecting knock-induced vibrations at these frequencies is to distinguish them from other engine vibrations also lying within these bands, these latter vibrations constituting noise. Prior patents disclose various approaches to the problem of distinguishing knock signals from background noise in a variety of ways.(11) At constant or slowly changing engine speeds knock can be detected without sophisticated techniques because it is not as difficult to monitor and compensate for the background noise. For example, it is possible to use an integrator to average background noise and to monitor vibrations against this background noise level. Examples of such detectors would be those first three patents enumerated above. Under dynamic operation, however, more sophisticated detectors are called for because the range of background noise begins to increase and overlap the range of knock signals thereby tending to increasingly mask any engine knock which may occur. Patents of the second category referred to above contain these more sophisticated approaches. While offering various degrees of improvement, many still suffer from the disadvantages described above such as not being able to detect knock under extreme transient conditions or being too expensive, etc. On the other side of the coin, care must be taken in the design of a knock detector to avoid false retarding of spark timing when knock is not in fact present. False retard could be a potential problem with certain types of systems. Thus, it must be appreciated that attainmen"}

False retard could be a potential problem with certain types of systems. Thus, it must be appreciated that attainment of a perfect or near-perfect knock detector is not an easy task.(12) Earlier patents disclose a variety of possible approaches to compensating for background noise. One approach disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 3,393,557 involves the provision of a knock band channel and an engine noise band channel each of which contains its own band pass amplifier and peak reading circuit. The outputs from the two peak reading circuits are monitored by a differential amplifier to provide an indication of knock. A possible objection to this approach is that it presumes that noise in the passband of the noise channel is the same as noise in the passband of the knock channel and such may not be, and indeed probably is not, the case.(13) U.S. Pat. No. 2,958,317 incorporates a threshold circuit which is set higher than the valve noise level. Only signals exceeding the threshold are monitored. A problem with this approach is that it is obviously not suited to accommodate the variety of range of conditions which would be encountered in an automobile engine in actual use in an vehicle.(14) Other patents set a threshold as a function of engine speed; for example, see U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,163,385 and 4,061,116. In U.S. Pat. No. 4,002,155 a background noise level reference is used to establish a threshold and the number of ringings occurring in the vibration signal which exceed the threshold are used to determine whether knock is occurring. This latter patent is also an example of a gated reference where the vibration signal is gated during a portion of the operating cycle when knock vibrations are not expected to occur to thus establish a reference. Other approaches may employ a gated knock where the vibration signal is gated during selected portions of the cycle when knock is expected to occur; for example, see U.S. Pat. No. 2,879,665.(15) One patent which seems to offer a possibly more effective approach than some of the other patents is U.S. Pat. No. 4,153,020 where the gain of an amplifier receiving the vibration signal is controlled as a function of background engine noise. However, a possible problem is that it may become less effective as the engine becomes worn.(16) Other approaches are shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,678,732; 3,950,981; 3,822,583; 4,111,035; 2,450,882, and 3,942,359.(17) The present invention is addressed to a new and improved knock detector which compensates more effectively to unmask engine knock in the presence of engine noise over the dynamic operating ranges encountered in an automobile engine, yet which is also highly immune to false retard of spark timing. While some of the individual techniques embodied in the practice of the invention are per se known in the art, the invention does comprise a novel means which compensates for the adverse influence of background noise on knock detection and which is well suited for an automobile engine on a mass production basis although obviously it is also useful for any type of engine knock detector. The invention is cost effective, is less complicated in circuitry, and very importantly, it achieves a high degree of consistency in accurately detecting incipient knock. Principles of the invention can be applied to various engine models with any required differences in scaling being made by selection of circuit component values. Although a preferred embodiment of the invention is herein disclosed, its principles may obviously be implemented in other embodiments.(18) In an automobile a constraint on electrical and electronic systems is the available voltage supply. Typically, in today's automobiles, the voltage supply is a 12 volt DC battery. Thus, electronic systems in the vehicle must operate on a supply voltage of somewhat less than 12 volts unless other techniques, such as voltage doubling, are emp"}

Thus, electronic systems in the vehicle must operate on a supply voltage of somewhat less than 12 volts unless other techniques, such as voltage doubling, are employed. The obvious disadvantage of such other techniques is that they add to the cost and complexity of the system. A typical supply voltage for state of the art electronic circuitry is five volts. This means that in an automobile engine knock detector using such a supply voltage, knock and noise signals being processed in the knock detector must be confined to this limited range over the engine vibrating range if useful information is to be obtained; i.e. saturation must be avoided. Prior systems have utilized integrators, averagers, and\/or low pass filters. Some have used variable attenuators. Yet, these approaches are not seen to be capable of providing reliable, accurate knock detection in automotive usage. They may either miss knock or they may falsely detect it.(19) A very desirable way to detect knock, disregarding background noise for the moment, is by utilizing peak detection. Peak detection allows even a single individual knock vibration to be detected thereby offering the potential for knock to be suppressed in its very incipiency. Peak detection, per se, in the context of an engine knock detector is well known as evidenced by the aforementioned U.S. Pat. No. 3,393,557. Now peak detection by its very nature involves detecting peak voltage. In the laboratory large voltage supplies are readily available and use of peak detection is not foreclosed by voltage supply constraints. Unfortunately, with the overlap in noise and knock signals ranges in an automobile, the use of peak detection appears unattractive in view of the low supply voltage.(20) The present invention, in a still further respect, makes feasible usage of the peak detection technique in a low voltage system in an automobile, encompassing the range of operational speeds and transients which may be encountered, reliably and accurately detecting knock in its incipiency to retard spark timing and yet allowing spark to be otherwise advanced in timing in accordance with desired schedules at such times as when knock is absent.(21) While the claims at the conclusion of the ensuing specification define the patented invention, the improvement which the invention provides may be briefly summarized as comprising in a knock detector: a sensor mounted on the engine, tuned to sense mechanical engine vibrations within a frequency band which will contain knock vibrations if knock occurs, and providing a corresponding electrical signal; an amplifier for amplifying the sensor electrical signal; a gated reference channel which receives the amplified signal and gates it to a detection circuit during intervals coincident with the absence of any appreciable engine knock with the detection circuit detecting a selected characteristic of the gated signal; a knock channel which couples the amplified signal to another detection circuit which detects a selected characteristic of the signal; a comparator which compares the detected signals detected by the two detection circuits to provide a knock detection signal in accordance with a predetermined relationship between the two indicative of engine knock; and means for sensing engine speed and attenuating, in accordance with engine speed, the gain of the amplifier such that the gain is in general made an inverse function of engine speed.

The knock detector may be employed in conjunction with either an analog spark advance system or a digital spark advance system whereby spark timing is retarded in response to detection of incipient knock and thereafter normal spark advance schedules are allowed to resume once the knock has dissipated.(22) The foregoing features, advantages, and benefits of the present invention, along with additional ones, will be seen in the ensuing description and claims which should be considered in conjunction with the accompanying drawings disclosing a preferred embodiment of the present invention according to the best mode presently contemplated in carrying out the invention."}

Field of Invention(3) The present invention relates generally to fluid directional control valves and more specifically to such valves which are electromagnetically operated.(4) 2. Description of the Prior Art(5) In many fields of application of fluid power such as the field of automotive automatic transmission design, the use of directional control valves has been limited to those which employ cylindrical spools, spring biased and pressure activated. Such valves are generally close fit and therefore suffer greatly from their attendant intolerance of contamination which results in sticking. Recognition of this potential for unreliability can, in certain circumstances, dictate uneconomical redundancy in design. Furthermore, the spool-type valve does not lend itself well to use with electronic operators which are coming into increasing commercial use. Because of their contamination intolerance, direct actuation of such valves, as with solenoids, requires high force and massive structure, and pilot operation through a smaller intermediary valve increases cost and complexity.(6) It is well known in the art that ball-type valves are relatively contaminant tolerant, but their use in solenoid actuated applications has been primarily limited to relatively low force pilot valve applications rather than applications in which relatively large primary flow passes through the valve. The prior art devices also have shown the use of relatively large solenoids which conventionally operate against relatively high preload forces. They have also made use of close fit cylindrical parts moving in pressure fluid for ball actuation which detracts from the contaminant tolerance of the overall assembly. They have further permitted high contact stresses between the ball member and its associated actuator, which further detracts from reliability of the valve assembly. In addition, the prior art valves have been unduly complex and uneconomical to produce.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) Responsive to the deficiencies in the prior art, it is an object of the present invention to provide a directly solenoid operated directional control valve that is resistant to sticking.(9) It is another object to provide such a valve which maximizes the actuation force and travel produced by the solenoid.(10) It is yet another object to provide such a valve which minimizes contact stresses in actuation.(11) It is still another object to provide such a valve which is simple and economical to produce.(12) According to one feature of the present invention, a solenoid operated directional control valve is provided which employs a minimal number of close fitting moving cylindrical parts.(13) According to another feature, the solenoid of the valve of the present invention is coupled to an actuating plunger for the valve portion with mechanical advantage and is arranged such that operation against large preload forces is not required.(14) According to yet another feature, contact between the valve operative structure and the actuating plunger therefore is maintained in the unactuated condition of operation to substantially prevent impact loading therebetween."}

The invention has specific applications in testing automotive rear window electric defoggers having a series of parallel grid lines deposited on the inside surface of the glass. Heretofore electrical continuity testing of the grid lines required an inspector to work from within the vehicle and touch each individual grid line with a voltmeter lead with the other lead grounded. This time consumming procedure allows only random spot-check inspection of the heater grids during the vehicle production line assembly.(3) The present invention has as an object to provide a continuity test device for window glass electrical grids that does not require any direct electrical connection with the grid lines.(4) It is another object to provide electrical continuity inspection of interior surface vehicle window grid heaters by testing each bank of grid lines exterior of the vehicle with a hand-held pen-like module or probe by sweeping the probe over the window outer surface. A further object is to provide a grid line test probe that will detect low level grid line voltages by minimizing the instruments sensitivity to stray electronic waves prevalent in industrial sites.(5) The novel probe of the invention may, in a repair mode, be moved across individual grid lines to check for continuity. Indicating means are provided in the form of light emitting diodes, an audio alert signal or the like incorporated within the probe. The probe in another mode is initially passed over the outside glass surface in a single transverse sweep across a bank of grid lines to provide a go or no-go production line check. Current, supplied to the grid lines from the vehicle's battery source flows in each parallel grid line, thus generating separate localized magnetic fields or regions having a predetermined flux density.(6) A pair of side-by-side Hall Effect Sensors, positioned near a glide face of the probe, are spaced a predetermined distance less than the transverse spacing of the grid lines. The sensor active portions are directed toward the opposed outside surface of the glass. As the probe is moved across the glass outer surface transverse to the direction of the grid lines each sensor is alternately exposed to a maximum flux intensity region and a minimum flux intensity region created by the energized grid lines. The sensors are spaced relative to the grid lines such that when one sensor is exposed to a maximum flux density region the other sensor is exposed to a minimum flux density region. The offset output voltages of the sensors, in the form of out-of-phase sinusoidal wave forms, are fed to a pair of input pins of an instrumentation amplifier which amplifies the difference between the input voltages. The output of the instrumentation amplifier is a composit pulsed waveform signal. A low pass filter circuit removes any direct current component of the signal.(7) The probe circuit further amplifies and compares the signal with a reference voltage. When a pulse of significant magnitude is sensed by the circuit it triggers on an electronic valve which turns-on visual and\/or acoustical signal means indicating to the operator each function grid line.(8) It is therefore a feature of the present invention to provide a handheld Hall Effect backlite pen instruement to readily detect breaks in vehicle window electric heater grid lines without requiring in-car inspection.

The drive gear is operative to move the rack along a track in one direction during upward closing movement of the pane and to move the rack in the other direction during downward opening movement of the pane. An elongated spiral convolute spring extends about the axis of the pinion with the inner end of the spring secured to the fixed pinion shaft. A coupling is formed on the pinion rim and spaced radially inwardly therefrom for releasable engaging a hook formed on the spring's outer end portion. Upon rotation of the drive gear by a manual crank handle causing translation of the rack on its track in a first direction and resultant concurrent rotary movement of the counterbalance pinion. The spiral spring is operative to store a portion of the potential energy of the windowpane when the pane is lowered tending to at least partially counterbalance the weight of the window pane as it is moved upwardly by the translation of the rack in a second direction by the drive gear.(7) The pinion has a unique T-shaped releasable spiral spring hook capturing means formed on the interior of the pinion rim. The capturing means is reversely symmetrical which allows the pinion to be used interchangeably on either the right-hand or left-hand side of the vehicle. A blank portion is provided in the pinion's external teeth which blocks the movement of the flexible rack after a predetermined length of travel on the track preventing the separation of the rack from the track.

As car sizes are reduced the structural frequencies correspondingly increase. The typical engine for the \"downsized\" cars is a four cylinder engine. These engines cause the vehicle body structure to be excited by the engine firing pulses through the engine mounts. When the engine pulses substantially coincide with the fundamental body structural resonance, objectional vibrations or resonant shake of the body may be felt by the operator in the steering wheel, floor pans, seat or other body components over the normal idle speed range of the engine.(5) The most common solution to such resonant shake problems involve isolating the engine from the body and frame by low rate engine mounts. Such engine mounts, however, at some point become impractical due to excessive engine deflections.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) The invention provides a bumper support system including a pair of bumper connectors extending from a vehicle frame supporting a horizontally disposed bumper bar. Each connector aft end remote from the bumper bar, is attached by pivotal means to the vehicle frame. The connector is elastically mounted to the frame by a bracket assembly comprising a pair of longitudinally spaced vertically disposed plate members denoted as the center plate and the limiter plate. The center plate is fixedly secured to its connector intermediate the ends of the connector. The limiter plate is adapted to be fixedly attached to the vehicle frame. A pair of isolator resilient mounts are arranged in symmetrical fashion from the connector axis to elastically interconnect the plates. The bumper bar is mounted on the front end of the pair of connectors for operation as a tuned dynamic absorber mass. This results from the connectors resiliently pivoting in substantially parallel longitudinally extending vertical planes over a determined vibration range about their respective pivotal means. The resultant bumper system causes a reduction in amplitude of the vehicle body and, thus its resonant shake because of the tuned frequency of the bumper bar.(8) It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an improved, easily manufactured and assembled bumper mounting system which functions as a tuned vibration absorber by pivoting the bumper bar mass at a spring rate to reduce the amplitude of the vehicle body and dampen resonant shake between the engine and the body components such as the floor pan, seats, steering column and the like during engine idle."}

More particularly this invention relates to a digital sample and hold circuit which memorizes the initial voltage across the electrical resistance probe.(3) Electrical resistance or hot-wire fluid level detection systems depend on the detection of probe resistance increase resulting from the application of a test current. The hot wire is mounted in a probe which in turn is positioned in the fluid to be monitored. The positive temperature coefficient characteristic of the hot wire produces a probe resistance increase when the test current is applied. The magnitude of this increase is proportional to the percentage of the hot wire element which is not immersed in fluid.(4) The sequence of electrical events which describe the complete fluid level sensing system are the application of current to the probe during the very short test interval, memorization of the initial voltage developed across the probe, measurement of the amplitude of the resistance change, comparison of the resistance change to a preselected threshold and the triggering of a warming signal when the fluid level is below the level corresponding to the preselected threshold.(5) In order to prevent the system from responding to resistance changes attrributable solely to the temperature of the probe environment, it is necessary to measure and memorize the initial resistance of the probe at the moment current is initially applied and to compare that initial resistance to the final resistance at the end of the test interval.(6) The warning threshold is selected to be between the energized probe's outputs representing the free air condition and the completely submersed condition.(7) Previous known designs have depended upon analog sample and hold circuits to memorize the initial probe resistance. Analog sample and hold circuits employ capacitors to retain a voltage proportional to the initial condition to be memorized.

An example of one such single shift rail manual transmission is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,222,281 issued Sept. 16, 1980 to Mylenek. With the advent of five speed gear boxes shift have required more effort by the driver to shift the various gears. Thus, there remains a need in the art to provide an improved single rail shifting mechanism that is compact while requiring minimal shifting effort by the driver.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) The primary object of this invention is to reduce gear hift lever operating efforts. To that end there is provided a single rail shift mechanism having an inner rod slidable within an outer slidable tubular member. A first and second (1-2) speed fork is held fixed on the tubular member. Selective engagement of the 1-2 fork by the gear selector actuates the tubular member and moves the 1-2 shift fork fore or aft to complete shifting in either the first or second gear of the transmission. Suitable bushings are press-fitted into each end of the tubular member bore to provide free reciprocal movement of the tubular member relative to the rod in the direction of its longitudinal axis.(6) A third and fourth (3-4) speed fork is slidably mounted on the tubular member to provide fore and aft reciprocal travel into third and fourth gears. A fifth speed shift fork is pinned at the free end of the shifter rod. Axial force on the one side of the fifth speed shifter notch actuates the rod and carries the fork in or out of fifth gear. A shift rod crosspin extends through a tap-drilled hole in the fifth speed shifter to control its position. This crosspin also extends through aligned control slots in the tubular rail to correctly position the fifth shifter. The arrangement minimizes binding of the 1-2 speed fork because the journaled tubular member slides freely relative to the rod during a first or second speed shift."}

Description of the Prior Art(5) In the past, various package-holding arrangements have been proposed for holding cargo, such as bags of groceries upright during transit in vehicle cargo storage areas. As evidenced by U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,986,315; 3,043,411; 3,986,656; 4,029,244; 4,226,348; 4,189,056; and 4,372,512 many varities of removable or collapsible package supports have been used in vehicle cargo areas. While the above patented devices are acceptable to retain the cargo during turning, sudden stops etc., they require time to assemble and are expensive to manufacture. Further, these prior art devices are unsatisfactory because even if they are collapsible they must be stowed in the vehicle occupying valuable storage space.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) It is, therefore, an object of this invention to provide a vehicle cargo organizer which provides for orderly loading of cargo such as grocery bags while insuring their retention during transit, sudden stops or the like.(8) It is another object of the invention to provide a vehicle cargo organizer which functions in one mode as cargo skid slats for loading cargo and in a second mode as a cargo organizer to support cargo against tipping over during transit.(9) To accomplish these and other objects of the invention, a preferred embodiment includes a plurality of substantially parallel slats extending longitudinally on the vehicle cargo floor from a rear access door opening, for example. The slats have their aft ends hinged to the floor for pivotal movement about a common transverse axis. A cross-rail connects the forward ends of the slats to define a storage rack. Each end of the cross-rail has a tie member, the free end of which is adapted to be secured to one side of the rear access door opening.(10) The rack normally provides cargo skids in its retracted position flush with the floor. The rack assembly assumes its cargo support mode upon being pivoted upwardly to a canted position and retained by the tie members which are readily attached to the vehicle body by hook members located on either side of the access opening. In its erected mode the rack assembly provides a cargo support with several cargo receiving spaces. Each rack space together with the closed liftgate is operative to maintain cargo placed therein in an upright position during operation of the vehicle."}

The driver controls the throttling rate of the engine by means of a foot pedal conveniently mounted internally of the car on the dash panel and easily accessible to the driver's foot. The gas pedal is connected to a lever which in turn is connected to one end of a throttle control cable. The throttle control cable passes through the dash panel into the engine compartment where it is connected to the throttle for actuation thereof. The driver increases or decreases the speed of the automobile by pressing down or letting up on the gas pedal.(3) In operation of a vehicle, the driver's foot constantly presses against the gas pedal. In the past, engine vibration has been transmitted to the gas pedal via the throttle control cable. This vibration, through slight, exerts a constant stress against the foot of the driver causing fatigue and annoyance.(4) The present invention provides a mounting structure to connect the throttle control cable to the lever actuated by the gas pedal. The mounting structure includes means for isolating the gas pedal from vibrations transmitted by the throttle control cable. The mounting structure is inexpensive to manufacture, of easy installation, and results in a positive mount.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) The mounting structure for throttle control cable includes a cable retainer adapted for reception in an elastomeric grommet mounted on a throttle lever actuatable by a gas pedal. The cable retainer has a head portion including an obverse face and a reverse face. A tubular portion extends axially outwardly from the obverse face. The tubular portion defines a passageway which also extends entirely through the head portion. The passageway is for the reception of the throttle control cable. The tubular portion has a transverse slot intermediate the ends thereof communicating with the passageway. A first longitudinally extending slot is provided in communication with the passageway extending from the transverse slot to the outer end of the tubular portion. A second longitudinal slot is provided in communication with the passageway extending from the transverse slot to the head portion. The head portion has a slot extending from the outer periphery thereof into communication with the passageway and with the second longitudinal slot whereby a flexible throttle control cable may be received in the passageway by first inserting a portion thereof through the transverse slot and then flexing the cable to pass through the first longitudinal slot, the second longitudinal slot and the slot in the head portion. The head portion has trap means on the reverse face thereof in alignment with the slot in the head portion permitting passage of the cable into the passageway while preventing passage of the cable out of the passageway."}

For example in the Okamoto et al U.S. Pat. No. 4,056,165 a bolted fixture is required. Such construction also has the disadvantage that it is not readily adaptable to different sized openings and requires installation tools, such as a screwdriver. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,799,483 to Chiappinelli disclose a mounting collar for an automobile radio having releasable locking means. In the Chiappinelli patent resilient clips are formed with locking grooves that receive and resiliently retain corresponding locking lips of a mounting collar.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) It is the primary object of the present invention to provide a readily installed removable speaker and grille mounting assembly requiring no attaching tools while insuring a shock and vibration free installation.(6) The speaker and grille mounting, according to the present invention, fits into a predetermined sized opening without the need of special locking collars or separate fasteners. The mounting uses spring clips each having shoulder and arm portions defining an obtuse included angle. The free end of the arm portion has a return-bend finger portion which slides axially on the speaker magnet as the speaker and grille assembly are inserted or removed. This sliding action occurs as the shoulder and arm portions are resiliently collapsed away from each other during passage of the clip arm portions through the panel opening providing a spring biased shock absorbing and vibration dampening installed engagement of the shoulder portions with the opening.(7) In addition to securely snapping the speaker and grille assembly into engagement with the panel opening, the clips provide a concealed but readily operable mounting arrangement. The clips also facilitate disengagement of the speaker and grille assembly from its associated panel so that the assembly may be removed and re-installed without damage to any parts.(8) Further objects and advantages of the present invention will be apparent from the following description, reference being made to the accompanying drawings wherein a preferred embodiment of the present invention is clearly shown."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the circuit control means in this invention?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the circuit control means in this invention is to work with a thermal resistive type fluid level sensor.","context":"US-4550261-A Fluid level sensor circuitry\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) This invention relates to a circuit control means to work with a thermal resistive type fluid level sensor. Although a thermistor type sensor could be used, the preferred embodiment uses a liquid level sensor which employs semiconductive material which, over a temperature range, exhibits a peak electrical resistance at a predetermined temperature and predetermined varying resistance over the rest of the temperature range. Such a device is further described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,065,760.(3) The subject invention is employed in an automotive engine environment to detect the level of engine oil. The invention provides for constant current excitation to the liquid level sensor. The constant current excitation is shut off under a no-oil condition thereby providing a no-oil signal to some type of message center while also protecting the oil level sensor from damage under this high temperature self-heat condition. Another advantage of utilizing the constant current excitation is that the response from the oil level sensor is very quick because maximum power can be delivered to the sensor.(4) If constant voltage excitation were utilized, a resistor would be placed in series with the sensor to limit the current drawn to that value of the sensor's maximum allowable power. The sensor exhibits peak resistance at a mid-range temperature value and exhibits minimal resistance at both low and high temperature values. Under a constant voltage excitation condition, the sensor, when operating at low temperatures, cannot heat up quickly enough to respond properly; this is due to the current limiting, resistive-drive excitation. The current draw at low temperatures will not sufficiently heat up the sensor by self-heating. At high temperatures when the sensor is excited with constant voltage, the current through the sensor is greater due to the device's decreased resistance at high temperatures. Therefore, the high temperature current rating limits the amount of current that you can safely source through the device with a limiting resistor. This limits the sensor, at lower temperatures where the device exhibits higher resistance, to a lower current draw than required for proper self-heating action and response.(5) If you drive the sensor with a constant current device, you can dissipate more power within the device and therefore operate it faster. With constant current excitation, a current value is selected to operate the sensor near the high temperature power limit at all times (with appropriate automatic over-temperature protection). This condition provides for the quick response from the sensor required (it is estimated that the response is in order of magnitude better than with constant voltage excitation). Constant current excitation also minimizes the effects of the voltage fluctuations typically experienced in automotive applications."}

An example of one such system is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,417,642 issued to Suzuki et al. on Nov. 29, 1983. The Suzuki patent describes a four-wheel drive transaxle incorporating a front to rear interaxle bevel gear differential and a planetary gear differential with a clutch lockout mechanism. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,400,777 issued to C. Hill on Sept. 10, 1968 relates to a three differential four-wheel drive system with a lock-out clutch designed for a rear engine drive vehicle. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,476,953 issued to Hiraiwa on Oct. 16, 1984 for a Four-Wheel Vehicle Drive System discloses a transaxle mechanism with two connected bevel gear differentials. The system requires an intermediate gear mechanism gear shaft for transmitting driving power to the rear-wheel driveline.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) In accordance with the present invention, a dual bevel gear differential assembly for a front wheel transaxle is adapted for installation in a vehicle providing a constant four-wheel drive system. The vehicle has a front mounted engine which extends transversely of the vehicle. A transmission, which also extends transversely of the vehicle, has its transverse input shaft drivingly connected to the crankshaft of the engine which is rotatable about an axis in a lateral or east-west direction of the vehicle. The transmission output shaft is parallel with its input shaft and is drivingly connected to the rotatable casing of a first front axle to rear axle or interaxle bevel gear differential. The interaxle differential has its case supported for rotation relative to the transaxle housing and provides differentiation between the front axle and the rear axle.(6) A second front-wheel to front-wheel bevel gear differential has its case rotatively supported within the transaxle housing. A first transverse side gear shaft has its outer end suitably connected to one front wheel drive shaft while its other end extends through the interaxle differential side gears and case for driven engagement with the inboard side gear of the front wheel differential. A second side gear shaft has its outer end suitably connected to the other front wheel drive shaft while its inner end is connected to the outboard side gear of the front wheel differential. An inner side gear sleeve surrounds the first side gear shaft and drivingly interconnects the interaxle differential outboard side gear with the rotatable casing of the front wheel differential.(7) An outer side gear sleeve surrounds the inner side gear sleeve and drivingly engages the interaxle front-to-rear differential inboard side gear to a crown or bevel gear mounted on the outer side gear sleeve. The crown gear is drivingly engaged with a mating cone gear on the front end of a longitudinal extending front axle to rear axle propeller shaft. A third rear axle differential is drivingly engaged by gear means on the rearward end of the propeller shaft.(8) Clutch means are provided to selectively transfer torque between the first bevel gear differential case and its outer side gear sleeve. With this arrangement the dual differential assembly provides a continuous four-wheel drive system with the interaxle bevel gear differential operative to differentially interconnect the front and rear differentials when the clutch means is disengaged.

The control stalk of the present invention is especially suited for use in automobile vehicle headlamp dimmer and turn signal switch mechanisms adapted for tilthead steering columns. The control stalk motion translating assemblies for turn signals and headlamp dimmer switches shown in the above-mentioned patents require extensive modification for use in a tilt steering column. The U.S. Pat.

This invention uniquely modifies the existing control stalk switch arrangement of the Koch et al. and Scarbro patents by providing a dimmer switch pivoting cam actuator formed with a compound curved or saddle-back shaped camming surface. The cam actuator, in cooperation with a cam operating finger arrangement, enables both the turn signal and dimmer switches to be actuated in any tilt position of the steering wheel adjustable head. Also, the dimmer switch can be operated with the turn signal switch in either the left or right turn signal position.(6) In this invention, the compound curved or saddleback shaped cam actuator surface has the center of curvature of its concave portion coincident with the tilt head transverse tilt axis.

In the prior art it has heretofore been the practice to mount a separate power take-off gear on the input shaft of the transfer case. Such an arrangement requires extensive redesign of an existing transfer case including an extension of the input shaft and housing to accommodate the power take-off gear. Space limitations may make such design adjustments impractical or financially prohibitive.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) Briefly, this invention comprises a transfer case adapted for use on a four-wheel drive vehicle having two-wheel drive and four-wheel drive operating modes.

An example of such selector is found in U.S. Pat. No. 2,917,941 to Writtren which discloses a shift selector detent having a generally cylindrical shape which is slidable and spring loaded on a shift lever. The Writtren selector is intended for a panel having a plurality of fore-and-aft slots interconnected by a transverse cross-over slot. Also, the Writtren selector requires a separate plate journaled on the shift lever positioned below the panel. This plate affords the operator a requisite amount of \"feel\" to determine when he is moving into and out of the reverse phase of the shift pattern.(4) The U.S. Pat. No. 3,998,109 to O'Brien is an example of typical automatic transmission shift control assembly having a simple longitudinal slot for pivotal movement of a shift lever. Although such prior art shifters function satisfactorily, there is a demand for a simple shifter which has a minimum number of parts and which can be manufactured economically.(5) BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) It is a feature of the present invention to provide a shift selector mechanism which has an improved detent feeling together with a positive detent positioning means. Another feature of the present invention is to provide an improved shift selector mechanism which is compact in size while operating in a smooth, noiseless manner.(7) According to the present invention, there is provided a shifter lever selector detent mechanism for a vehicle automatic transmission comprising a stepped plastic detent plunger. The plunger has transversely extending stepped blocks with parallel tread surface adapted to be successively spring biased into sliding contact with an arcuate undersurface of a sector plate. A longitudinally extending slot is formed in the sector plate including a series of interconnected notches having progressively decreasing widths in both fore and aft directions from a central notch defining a plurality of paired transverse locator edges. As the shift lever swings the stepped detent plunger within the slot in a reverse arcuate path from the central notch position the locator edges are adapted to successively engage and retain the plunger in selected operating modes of the transmission.(8) The successive plunger operating modes are attained by spring biasing button means on the lever operative to bias the plunger toward the shift lever handle. As a result successive opposed pairs of stepped treads are brought into sliding engagement with the arcuate concave undersurface of the sector plate. In the disclosed form the plunger has a pair of side wall portions each defining three mirror image step-up blocks. Thus, upon the lever being moved in the reverse arcuate direction from its intermediate \"neutral\" central notch position, the plunger may be successively retained in three selected locations, defining drive, second speed, and low speed mode positions. This may be done by depressing the plunger once between drive and second speed and again between second speed and low speed. The plunger may be returned to the control notch by being successively biased out of the low speed mode position into the second speed mode position and thence into its drive or neutral central notch modes without the operator depressing the selection lever button.

The locking notch has a width equal to that of the low speed notch while the park mode notch has a width corresponding to the drive and neutral mode notch.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the snap-in lamp terminal in the assembly?","groundtruth":"The snap-in lamp terminal improves electrical contact between the bulb and terminal and allows the terminal to be used in a socket housing made from soft vinyl material.","context":"US-4624523-A Cantilevered redundant terminal\n(1) The portion of the term of this patent subsequent to the term of the patent issued from now allowed U.S. application Ser. No. 06\/752,265 has been disclaimed.(2) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(3) This invention relates to a snap-in lamp terminal for wedge-base bulbs used in an assembly with a wedge-base bulb socket. The invention improves electrical contact between the bulb and terminal and allows the terminal to be used in a socket housing made from soft vinyl material.(4) Components of the socket assembly are the wedge-base bulb, the snap-in lamp terminal, the snap-in tubular socket or, when situations demand, the vinyl socket housing. Their descriptions follows.(5) The wedge-base bulb is made up of a bulbular evacuated chamber fused to a wedge-base. The wedge-base configuration includes a raised centrally located cylindrical vent tube running along the central longitudinal axis of the bulb. The vent tube is bound on both sides by laterally extended side wings. The bulb also has a lamp filament wire which extends through and out the bottom end of the side wings in such a manner that on either side of the vent tube there is only one end of the filament wire. Each end is bent or looped back upon itself and reentrant in and sealed in the wedge-base. This looped formation is then bent back onto the wedge-base extending towards the bulbular evacuated chamber, one looped wire on the front of the wedge-base, the other on the back side. The wedge base also has two concave detent troughs extending transversely to the longitudinal axis of the bulb. Each detent trough is located on the opposite side of the side wing where the filament wire extends. Thus, on one side of the wedge-base on the side wing, left of the vent tube, the filament wire loop extends toward the bulbular evacuated chamber. On the side wing to the right of the vent tube is the transversely extending detent trough.(6) The next component of the socket assembly is the snap-in lamp terminal. The snap-in terminal is made up of a channel shaped body, extending longitudinally, surrounding contact arms attachd to each side. The front entry-way of the terminal has a wire guide protruding from one side of the channel body. The rear of the terminal has a mold fill retention wall to allow the terminal to be molded directly into a vinyl socket. This wall is only necessary when a vinyl socket assembly is made by injecting vinyl material into a mold with the terminals present.(7) Located inside the terminal channel body is a redundant contact terminal means (to be explained later).(8) The socket assembly designed for the wedge-base bulb then consists of a pair of snap-in lamp terminals held either by a molded vinyl lamp socket or a hard tubular snap-in lamp socket. The tubular socket has an interior rib dividing the interior of the socket into two longitudinally extending channels. These channels accept the snap-in lamp terminals and hold them in place by a cantilevered wedge clamp running along the outside longitudinal axis of the tubular socket. Upon insertion of the terminals, the socket assembly, now complete, is ready for the installation of the wedge-base bulb.(9) The wedge-base bulb is axially inserted into the front of the socket assembly and makes electrical contact with the terminals which allows for energization of the bulb. This electrical contact is accomplished through the surface contact of the bulb's filament wire and the terminal's contact arm. Specifically, upon installation of the bulb, the wedge base is squeezed by the two contact arms of the terminal. One contact arm exerts spring pressure on the side wing of the bulb where it interlocks with the detent trough. The other contact arm exerts spring pressure on the opposite side of the same side wing where it makes electrical contact with the bulb's filament wire. This electrical contact is made only if the filament wire is in its proper mating position. Tha"}

This electrical contact is made only if the filament wire is in its proper mating position. That proper position is between the exterior edge of the side wing and the edge of the central vent tube where the wire extends towards the bulbular evacuated chamber parallel with the longitudinal axis of the bulb.(10) Often, the filament wire is not in this correct mating position due to the manufacturing and handling process. When such occurs, the wedge-base bulb must be manually removed from the socket and the filament wires manually straightened to provide proper electrical contact upon re-installation of the bulb.(11) To provide for better filament wire positioning, not through costly manual means, but by utilizing an alignment device upon insertion of the bulb, a wire guide means was introduced into previous terminal designs. This wire guide means protrudes out toward the center of the terminal channel and wipes near the surface of the vent tube. This wiping action was designed to realign a filament wire skewed onto the middle of the wedge-base extending across the body of the vent tube. Realignment occurs when the wire guide interferes with the filament wire and pushes it back to its proper mating position. Alignment of skewed filament wires protruding toward the exterior edge of the side wing occurs by interference with the terminal base. This interference urges the skewed filament wire back to its proper mating position.(12) The wire guide in some cases cannot reach extremely skewed filament wires and the terminal base cannot align skewed alignment wires to the extreme outer edge of the side wing. Because of these extremely skewed filament wires, a wedge-base bulb might light intermittently or possibily not at all and a costly manual realignment of the filament wires becomes necessary.(13) The preferred embodiment urges better electrical contact upon installation. The subject invention provides a wire guide which wipes onto and not near the surface of the vent tube urging better alignment for even extremely skewed filament wires onto the vent tube.(14) The subject invention also provides a redundant contact terminal means whereby a skewed filament wire, not properly aligned by the improved wire guide or the terminal base, will still be urged to make proper electrical contact by providing a second contact surface in the interior of the terminal channel.(15) Previously designed snap-in lamp terminals were restricted in their utility because they could not be molded into vinyl without costly manufacturing provisions to prevent the vinyl mold fill from leaking into the terminal channel and insulating the electrical contact arms. The preferred embodiment remedies this problem by providing a wall in the rear of the terminal which will stop the flow of the vinyl mold fill into the interior of the terminal channel. This provision allows the preferred embodiment to be molded directly into the vinyl socket providing a less costly water resilient vinyl socket.(16) It is, therefore, an object of the invention to provide a snap-in lamp terminal for wedge-base bulbs with improvements in the wire guide design to urge proper alignment of the filament wires of the bulb which may be skewed onto the central vent tube.(17) Another object of the invention is to provide a redundant contact terminal means to urge proper electrical contact should the terminal base or the improved wire guide fail to realign the filament wire to its proper mating position. This redundant contact terminal means is demonstrated in the invention showing the snap-in lamp terminal incorporating four different structures of the redundant contact terminal means.(18) Still another object of the invention is to incorporate a mold fill retention wall in the rear of the terminal so that the snap-in terminal can be used with a soft vinyl filled socket without flow of the mold m"}

Field of the Invention(3) This invention relates to illumination devices for motor vehicles and more particularly to a combination dome\/cargo lamp for a pickup truck.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) It is desired that a pickup truck be provided with a dome lamp for the interior of the cab to illuminate the cab. It is also desirable to provide a lamp for illuminating the cargo box of a pickup truck. Such a lamp is useful at night to permit loading and unloading or other activity in connection with the cargo box. Of course, separate lamps may be provided for these purposes, i.e., a dome lamp within the cab and a cargo lamp within the cargo box. However, for the convenience of the user of the pickup truck and to reduce cost, it would be desirable to combine the functions of cab illumination and cargo box illumination in a single lamp.(6) Swing-down lamps have recently been offered commercially and form a desirable feature readily adapted to the pickup truck configuration. In such constructions, a lamp fixture is secured to the headliner within the pickup cab adjacent to the rear window. The lamp fixture normally serves as a dome lamp and is operated conventionally by means of an on\/off switch accessible to the cab occupant. The lamp employs a swing-down construction whereby it may be swung out of the ceiling and aimed through the rear window of the pickup truck into the cargo box to illuminate the cargo box.(7) In accordance with the present invention, such a swing-down construction is provided. The construction of the present invention includes guard means to prevent touching of the electrical wires associated with the lamp, it being appreciated that in a swing-down construction, it is necessary to have electrical wires which are not rigidly mounted so that they may swing with the lamp. The present invention provides guard structure to prevent touching of the electrical wiring by the hand of the person operating the lamp fixture. Such touching is undesirable inasmuch as the wiring may be damaged and it is broadly desired not to have electrical wiring be touchable for safety reasons.(8) The present construction also includes a unique feature for spring locking the swing-down portion of the lamp in the dome light configuration. This results in secure positionment of the lamp when it is used as a dome light while at the same time permitting easy manipulation of the lamp into a cargo box illuminating position.(9) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(10) A combination dome\/cargo lamp for a pickup truck is provided. The pickup truck is of the type including a cargo box and cab having a rear window permitting viewing of the cargo box. The dome\/cargo lamp comprises an outer casing having an upper portion securable to the ceiling of the cab adjacent to the rear window. The outer casing has a lower portion. An inner casing is provided. Pivot means connect the inner casing to the lower portion of the outer casing. An electric bulb is provided in the inner casing. A lens is provided on the inner casing covering the bulb to direct light outwardly of the inner casing. The inner casing is pivotable by hand into the outer casing where the lens will direct light into the cab thereby functioning as a dome lamp. The inner casing is also pivotable by hand downwardly away from the outer casing to a position where the lens will direct light through the rear window into a cargo box thereby functioning as a cargo lamp. The outer casing has an opening therethrough adjacent to the pivot means. An arcuate cover extends from the inner casing through the opening.

{"question":"What is the invention described in US-4631628-A?","groundtruth":"The invention described in US-4631628-A is an electronic fuel injector driver circuit.","context":"US-4631628-A Electronic fuel injector driver circuit\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) The present invention relates to electronic fuel injection systems for internal combustion engines and in particular to an electronic control circuit for controlling the energization of electromagnetic fuel injection valves.(3) With the ever increasing demands on fuel economy and emissions control for vehicles, the application of electronically controlled fuel delivery systems has become increasingly prevalent. Recently, with the advent of powerful, inexpensive microprocessors, these controllers have become highly sophisticated, monitoring and\/or precisely controlling such engine parameters as fuel-air ratio, ignition timing, ambient air and exhaust gas temperatures, oxygen in the exhaust system, etc. Particularly in the area of emissions control, current technology relies on extremely precise control of fuel-air ratio. For example, three-way catalysts have a fuel-air ratio \"window\" of only approximately one percent within which they operate reasonably efficiently on all three emission components; namely hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx). Excursions of the fuel-air ratio outside this window not only result in low conversion efficiency during the excursion, but also reduce the operating temperature of the catalyst thereby resulting in a loss of conversion efficiency for a period after the fuel-air ratio has been brought back within the window.(4) In throttle body injection systems, the metering of fuel is controlled by an electromagnetic injection valve. A fuel injector typically comprises a precise orifice which is connected through a solenoid valve to a source of pressurized fuel. The valve is actuated via energization of the solenoid coil by a pulsed electrical signal characterized by a pulse width (PW) and a frequency (f). The amount of fuel delivered is thus given by the formula:(5) Fuel Flow=PW.times.f.times.C;(6) wherein C is a constant determined in accordance with the size of(7) the orifice and fuel pressure.(8) Because pulse widths can be as small as a millisecond in typical applications, the mechanical delay in the operation of the solenoid valve becomes significant, requiring the above approximation to be refined. The delay in opening the solenoid valve depends on the rate at which current through the coil builds--i.e., voltage--while the closing delay is essentially fixed. Accordingly, a more useful relationship is expressed as follows:(9) Fuel Flow=(PW+Offset (V)).times.f.times.C.(10) Experience has shown that, in order to obtain consistent delays or \"offsets\", it is desirable to initially allow the injector current to build to a high value until the valve begins to move and then reduce the injector current to a lower or \"holding\" value for the remainder of the solenoid pulse to avoid excessive heating of the injector winding. At the end of the pulse, the injector current is then rapidly decayed by allowing a large induced voltage to develop in the winding of the solenoid.(11) In multipoint fuel injection systems, the above control sequence is typically accomplished by operating a power transistor into saturation until the desired peak current is reached, turning the transistor off briefly until the injector current decays to the desired \"hold\" value, and then maintaining the \"hold\" current by operating the transistor in its active region until the transistor is turned off at the end of the pulse. However, because of high transistor power dissipation in the active \"hold\" region, relatively large heat sinks are required. While such heat dissipation is managable in multipoint fuel injection systems where the individual injectors are fairly small, in throttle body fuel injection systems where a single large injector is utilized to meter fuel flow, the increased force required to move the injector valve requires significantly higher current levels, resulting in commensurately higher lev"}
{"question":"What is the primary object of the present invention?","groundtruth":"The primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved control circuit for an electronic fuel injection system.","context":"ere a single large injector is utilized to meter fuel flow, the increased force required to move the injector valve requires significantly higher current levels, resulting in commensurately higher levels of heat. For example, the current requirements of a multipoint fuel injector typically are I-peak\/I-hold of 2A\/0.5A respectively, while those of an exemplary single point fuel injector are 6-8.8A\/1.5A. Thus, in automotive throttle body fuel injection applications, the active region method of maintaining \"hold\" currents may become impractical due to the difficulty of dissipating the increased levels of heat generated.(12) As a potential solution to this problem, it has been proposed that the desired injector holding current be maintained by rapidly switching the power transistor on and off at an appropriate switching frequency. This approach is taught, for example, in Schultzke et al., U.S. Pat. No. 4,180,026, assigned to Robert Bosch GmbH. The disadvantage of this approach, however, is that the induced voltage which develops in the injector winding during the periods when the transistor is turned off causes the injector current to decay rapidly during shut-off, thus requiring a relatively high switching frequency to avoid injector \"chatter\" and maintain the desired average holding current level. High switching frequencies can, however, cause switching dissipation and radio frequency interference problems. In addition, performance of the injectors may be less than optimal, particularly at small injector pulse widths.(13) Accordingly, it is the primary object of the present invention to provide an improved control circuit for an electronic fuel injection system.(14) In addition, it is an object of the present invention to provide an improved electronic fuel injection control circuit which produces highly consistent delays in the actuation of the fuel injector valve.(15) Furthermore, it is an object of the present invention to provide an electronic fuel injection control circuit which is capable of precisely controlling relatively large single port fuel injectors without creating a heat dissipation problem.(16) It is also an object of the present invention to provide an electronic fuel injection control circuit which provides improved linearity in the operation of the fuel injector.(17) Additional objects and advantages of the present invention will become apparent from a reading of the detailed description of the preferred embodiment which makes reference to the following set of drawings in which :"}

In other words, the engine has been made to perform well as a high speed pump. To achieve high speed pumping capacity, typical engine valving events are utilized such as: an early intake valve opening (in relation to top dead center or TDC) and a late exhaust valve closing (EVC). This results in a very large valve overlap during which both intake and exhaust valves are open simultaneously. It has long been standard practice that a large valve overlap is necessary for good engine power at high speeds.(4) Unfortunately, a large valve overlap also has the effect of greatly decreasing the engine ability to idle economically. In fact, to idle such an engine at a reasonably low speed, the standard practice is to to supply an overly rich fuel\/air mixture to the engine and to use retarded ignition timing. This results in poor idle fuel economy.(5) The object of applying the subject method to engine valve events is to decrease valve overlap and hence improve engine idle fuel economy without substantially decreasing high speed performance. This is accomplished primarily by delaying the intake-valve opening (IVO) from traditional positions in relation to TDC. Resultantly, valve overlap is greatly decreased and idle performance and economy are enhanced."}

To prevent accidental shifting various types of interlock and detent mechanisms have been suggested. The U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,537,584 to Carhart and 3,104,558 to Herr, Jr. are examples of prior art interlock plate-like lug devices which hold a pair of sliding rails in neutral while a third rail is being shifted or is in gear. These mechanisms, however, have not been entirely satisfactory from the standpoint of reliability, simplicity of construction and cost of manufacture.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) The present invention meets all the requirement of an interlocking system for a three shift rail manual transmission, but has decided advantages over the existing designs such as disclosed in the above-mentioned patents.(6) It is a feature of the invention that the pair of interlocking lugs are arranged in a symmetrical encapsulating manner with a pair of outboard shift rails and a center shift rail disposed parallel longitudinally extending relation. The lugs are generally I-shaped and each lug is adapted to selectively interengage one outboard shift rail and the center shift rail in an encapsulating self-supporting manner such that the transmission is restricted from being in more than one gear at a time. The interlocking lugs \"hold\" one transmission sliding clutch in neutral while the other sliding clutch is being shifted or is in gear.(7) It is another feature of the present invention to provide a pair of identical generally I-shaped interlocking lugs for a three shift rail manual transmission which are \"sandwiched\" between a pair of vertically disposed longitudinally spaced, parallel, flat surfaces. The flat surfaces, located in a bearing plate and transmission case, for example, require no exterior to interior machining operations and thus obviate close tolerance production problems.(8) Still another feature of the present invention is that the generally I-shaped interlocking symmetrical lugs eliminate special handling in assembly and are readily servicable.(9) A further advantage of the present invention is to provide a pair of identical generally I-shaped interlocking lugs for three shift rails which rails are arranged With their principal axis spaces in a symmetrical equally spaced manner on the arc of a circle and with the center rail axis positioned at the zenith of the arc such that identical shift forks may be used interchangeably on any one of the three shift rails."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the cable bundler clip?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the cable bundler clip is to bundle together cables in a parallel relationship, preventing tangling and providing an attractive appearance.","context":"US-4637097-A Cable bundler clip\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) Conventionally, cables which are present in the same area of a vehicle are bundled together at spaced apart locations to prevent tangling and for aesthetic purposes. For example, it is desired in an automobile to bundle the throttle cable, the kick-down cable and the speed control cable together inasmuch as they are all present in about the same location, these cables extending from the vehicle firewall or floor area into the engine compartment. These cables are of the type, for example, operating on the Bowden principle and function as mechanical actuators. In the past, cable bundling has been accomplished by use of conventional tie straps of the type employing a plastic band which is tightened around the cables. Such tie straps have been effective in operation. However, tie straps suffer the disadvantage of requiring what is, by today's standards, an inordinate amount of labor to install. It is necessary for the assembler to first mount the strap and then tighten the strap tightly in place. Finally, he must clip off the excess portion of the strap. Further, tie straps do not result in bundling cables in a parallel relationship.(3) In accordance with the present invention, a cable bundler clip is provided which employs a simple latching mechanism, thus permitting rapid installation with a minimum amount of labor. The cable bundler clip is provided with discrete recesses for reception of individual cables thus permitting the cables to be arranged in parallel relationship. The cable bundler is further advantageous in that it will effectively and securely enclose either two or three cables in a bundle. Prior art bundling clamps have been proposed such as the clamp disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,426,754. However, such clamps have not provided for securely bundling together a number of cables less than the number of cables for which the clamp is designed.(4) The present invention is also advantageous in that it is constructed to be of a minimum size thus avoiding a bulky appearance and saving space as well as the materials of fabrication. The cable bundler clip of the present invention results in the desired parallel arrangement of the cables with a resultant attractive appearance. The cable bundler clip also results in frictionally engaging the cables in a manner to prevent sliding of the clip along the length of the cables, this being true whether two or three cables are bundled.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) The cable bundler clip comprises a clip structure including a pair of clip halves. Each clip half has a pair of longitudinal edges. A hinge connects adjacent edges of the clip halves thereby hingedly joining the halves together. The hinge permits the clip halves to be swung to a closed position wherein the other edges of the clip halves substantially meet to define an inner tubular surface which is used for enclosing a plurality of cables. A latching structure is provided on the clip halves for securing the clip halves together in the closed position.(7) A rib structure is provided within each of the clip halves. The rib structure within one clip half is oppositely disposed from the rib structure in the other clip half when the clip halves are in the closed position. The rib structure of one clip half has first and second side-by-side recesses formed therein. The rib structure of the other clip half has a third recess formed therein. The third recess is located centrally of the first and second recesses when the clip halves are in the closed position. Rib structure material of the other clip half is provided on each side of the third recess. This rib structure material overlaps the first and second recesses when the clip halves are in the closed position. Each of the recesses is adapted to receive a cable.

{"question":"Why is accurate measurement of throttle position important in automotive applications?","groundtruth":"Accurate measurement of throttle position is important in automotive applications because it allows for precise engine control and optimization.","context":"US-4637361-A Non-adjustable throttle position indicator\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) Accurate measurement of throttle position is important when using engine control means for automotive applications. Past designs of throttle position indicators include two-position throttle switches and various potentiometric devices.(3) The two-position throttle switch provides an electrical signal to the engine control means when the throttle is in one of two positions: typically closed and wide open. These switches require service after a period of use as exposure to an automotive environment may cause the deterioration of the materials in the switch. Service or replacement of the switch would eventually be necessary in order to provide the electronic engine controls with an accurate indication of the throttle position.(4) Another throttle position indicator which has been used is a potentiometric device. This is also known as a throttle pot. The throttle pots are mounted on the exterior of the throttle body or carburetor and are connected to the throttle blade linkage in such a fashion so as to deflect the wiper arm of the throttle pot in proportion to the movement of the throttle blade. The potentiometric location of the closed throttle position and the wide open throttle position is established during the assembly process. This is done by mechanically mounting the throttle pot with the wiper arm in a pre-established location with respect to the fully closed position of the throttle blade. The throttle pot then provides readings to the engine control means, all referenced to the mechanically set base line, which is usually the closed throttle position. The accuracy of the adjustable throttle pot is in direct proportion to the skill of the assembler and to the integrity of the mechanical fastening means holding the throttle pot to the throttle body. Eventually, the adjustable throttle pot may need service to account for wear in the throttle blade linkage and possible deterioration of the potentiometer.(5) The subject invention seeks to eliminate the need for mechanical adjustment of the throttle pot during the assembly process and also seeks to eliminate the need for service adjustments on the adjustable throttle pot due to throttle body linkage wear.(6) This is accomplished by using a conventional throttle potentiometer with a modified mounting mechanism which is nonadjustable. In other words, the assembler will need only to affix the throttle pot to the throttle body at the designated location and insert the appropriate mounting devices, such as screws, through fixed guiding means. The assembly can then be completed without the need of any adjustments or decisions to be made by the assembler.(7) The need for an accurate measure of the throttle position still exists so the engine control means is now employed: to continuously check the position of the throttle, to memorize the lowest throttle position reading from the throttle pot, and to define this position as closed throttle. The reading is then updated to compensate for wear in the throttle blade linkages or in the potentiometric device or due to temperature or other conditions. The engine control means will read and retain the lowest measured value of the potentiometric voltage output. This value will then be stored in memory and identified as the closed throttle output until it is necessary to redefine it.(8) Additional features of measuring the throttle position in the above-described manner include: the prohibition of false readings due to low cranking voltages; the establishment of a default value upon the reset of memory (usually due to the disconnection of the battery); the ability to reset (a default condition) if no closed throttle indication occurs between two sequential cranking events."}

An example of such an articulated windshield wiper arm assembly is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,793,670 issued Feb. 26, 1974 to Riester et al. The Riester et al patent shows a wiper mechanism with a wiper arm having its fixed or inner end secured to a pivot shaft and a pivot block at its free or outer end. A control or drag arm is shown pivotally connected at its inner end to a pivot pin adjacent the pivot shaft. At its outer end the drag arm is pivotally connected on an axis parallel to but spaced from the axis of the wiper arm forming a parallelogram linkage for pivoting the blade with respect to the wiper arm as the assembly traverses its arcuate path.(4) The U.S. Pat.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the vehicle reading\/courtesy lamp?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the vehicle reading\/courtesy lamp is to provide interior lighting within vehicles for the convenience of occupants.","context":"US-4659889-A Vehicle reading\/courtesy lamp\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) 1. Field of the Invention(3) This invention relates to a vehicle reading\/courtesy lamp of the type mounted on the interior of a vehicle for the convenience of occupants.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) It is common practice to provide interior lighting within vehicles to facilitate people getting in and out, finding or handling articles within the vehicle, and reading such things as maps and addresses. One problem associated with lamps which have been provided in the past has been finding the switch actuating lever in the dark. Such levers are relatively small and must be found by feeling around the lamp structure.(6) In accordance with the present invention, such a lamp is provided having a rotatable switch actuating ring therearound. It is only necessary for an occupant of the vehicle to locate the lamp fixture and then grasp the outside periphery of the lamp (where the ring is located) and turn the ring to switch the lamp on.(7) The ring itself has a pair of spaced apart interior arms each of which is located on one side of a switch actuating lever, the lamp switch being located interiorly of the structure. Rotation of the ring in one direction will cause one of the arms to contact the switch actuating lever and move it to one position while turning of the ring in the opposite direction will cause the other of the arms to contact the switch actuating lever and move it to a second position, thus permitting switching of the lamp on and off by simple manipulation of the ring. This general technique, that is providing an arm on each side of switch lever with the arms being movable by means of a knob or the like to cause switch actuation, has been suggested in the past. For example, the broad use of such structure has been disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,449,213, Fredrick, Sept. 14, 1948; 3,075,396, Smith, Jan. 29, 1963; 3,356,819, Zavertnik et al, Dec. 5, 1967; and 3,373,621, Mundshenk, Mar. 19, 1968.(8) However, in accordance with the present invention, such structure is not only used for the purpose of switching an electrical apparatus on and off, it is also used as a stop means for the ring to limit ring movement to a prescribed arc. This facilitates use of peripherally spaced apart projections on the interior of the ring and similar spaced apart projections on the exterior of the lamp body as a means for assembling these two elements in operative relationship. The projections and spaces are first placed in registry whereupon the ring is mountable on the lamp body. The two elements are subsequently rotated through an arc which causes the projections to overlap each other and thereby prevent separation of the elements. The limited movement permitted by the switch actuating lever of the ring with respect to the lamp body prevents re-registry of the projections and spaces thereby preventing separation of the elements.(9) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(10) A vehicle reading\/courtesy lamp is provided. The lamp includes a generally cylindrical lamp body having a central opening therethrough. A bulb is mounted on the lamp body and is positioned to cast light through the lamp body opening. The switch actuating ring is provided on the lamp body. The ring has at least one inwardly extending projection on the inner periphery thereof. The lamp body has at least one radially outwardly extending projection on the outer periphery thereof. The ring is rotatably mounted on the lamp body with the projections initially passing by each other and with the ring and lamp body subsequently being rotated relative to each other to place the projections in overlapping relationship to prevent separation of the ring and lamp body. An electrical switch is connected to the bulb and connectable to electric power to control energization of the bulb. The switch is mounted on one of the ring and lamp body.

The switch actuating lever limits relative rotation of the ring and lamp body to prevent the projections moving to position where they do not overlap thus preventing separation of the ring and lamp body.(11) Preferably, a plurality of spaced-apart radially inwardly extending projections are provided on the inner periphery of the ring and a plurality of spaced apart radially outwardly extending projections are provided on the outer periphery of the lamp body. The space between the projections on the ring and lamp body are of sufficient size to permit passage of the projections on the ring and lamp body by each other.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the fuel injection system described in the context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the fuel injection system described in the context is to combine the characteristics of a fuel injector and a carburetion system to create a cost-effective and efficient fuel system for internal combustion engines.","context":"US-4674460-A Fuel injection system\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) Until recently, carburetors have been utilized on automobile internal combustion engines to regulate the quantity of fuel and air delivered thereto to produce power over a wide speed range. Recently, electrically controlled fuel injection systems have been used in association with throttle body housings. The throttle body housing has an inlet passage therethrough with a pivoted throttle blade to control the volume of air delivered to the engine. The fuel injector is controlled by an electrical signal to produce an adjustably variable fuel spray into the inlet passage of the throttle body. This regulates the necessary quantity of fuel to mix with air flowing through the throttle body as regulated primarily by the throttle blade.(3) For many years, the carburetor has been satisfactory in providing a desired control of air and fuel for engine operation. The recent emphasis on stringent fuel economy, further decreased exhaust emissions and an upward trend in fuel volatility has focused attention on the weakness of carburetors.(4) The aforementioned electrically controlled fuel injector in a throttle body produces superior fuel economy by very accurately controlling air\/fuel ratios. The subject fuel injection system is superior to over-throttle fuel injection systems currently used principally due to a higher degree of fuel atomization at idle.(5) It would be desirable to provide a fuel system combining the characteristics of the fuel injector and a carburetion system to thus produce a relatively low cost and efficient fuel system for internal combustion engines.(6) In a basic electrically controlled fuel injection system which is currently used, a fuel injector is mounted within a throttle body and produces a variable duration spray of fuel into the air passage which leads to the engine's combustion chambers. The fuel injector is typically located to spray fuel directly into the inlet passage upstream or above the throttle blade of the throttle body. Patents which illustrate this type of arrangement are U.S. Pat. No. 4,458,650 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,503,826. This basic arrangement is generally satisfactory, but is not particularly effective in producing good fuel atomization when the engine is idling.(7) A slight modification of the above described basic fuel injection system is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,442,818 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,475,518. In this modification, a fuel injector is mounted in the throttle body for injection above the throttle blade for higher speed operation, but another electrically controlled fuel device controls a bypass circuit during idle operation of the engine.(8) Another modification of the basic fuel injection system is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,276,862. It discloses a throttle body with a fuel injector mounted to spray fuel into the air passage upstream of the throttle blade and includes means to facilitate idle operation of the engine. The means includes a bypass of circuit of the throttle blade controlled by an adjustable needle valve for regulating the mexture of fuel with air. This type of idle control is like use in previous carburetion systems.(9) Lastly, a modification of the basic fuel injection system is found in U.S. Pat. No. 4,495,802, which discloses an electrically controlled injector to introduce fuel to the inlet passage downstream from a throttle blade. The patent does not disclose any alternate or separate means to introduce fuel and air during engine idle. Other arrangements of a fuel injector within a throttle body are shown in the following U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,395,989; 4,406,266; 4,508,091; 4,509,483; and 4,524,743.

The introduction of the fuel is through a spray bar means or the equivalent located downstream from the throttle blade. This would appear to be ineffective, particularly during idle and wide-open-throttle operation.(10) It is desirable to combine the superior fuel atomization characteristics of this fuel injection system, particularly at idle, with a means to control cylinder-to-cylinder distribution at wide-open-throttle. However, it has been found that the direct injection of fuel into the air passage against a substantially closed throttle blade produces undesirable fuel atomization. Therefore, the introduction of fuel and air downstream from the throttle blade is desirable during idle. On the other hand, it has been found that excellent fuel atomization and cylinder-to-cylinder distribution is achieved by directing fuel spray from the injector to a venturi means located upstream or before the throttle blade, particularly at higher engine speeds when the throttle blade is toward a wide-open position. Consequently, the subject system utilizes an electrically controlled fuel injector mounted to spray fuel into a cavity communicated by a first opening therefrom through a first passage into the air passage of the throttle body at a location below the throttle blade. The first passage means is utilized for idle and part-throttle during relatively low speed engine operation. A second opening and passage to the cavity is connected to a venturi means or device located in the throttle body at a location upstream or before the throttle blade. When the throttle blade is in a more nearly open position and, consequently, the air flow through the throttle body increases significantly, fuel passes from the cavity through the second passage to the venturi means where the fuel is effectively mixed with air flow passing therethrough. Thus, fuel is thoroughly atomized and mixed with air during the mid and higher speed operation of the engine.(11) From the above discussion, it is clear that the subject fuel injection system utilizes a dual fuel passage system extending from the electrically controlled fuel injector. The dual passage system automatically changes from the introduction of fuel below the throttle blade during idle or low speed engine operation to the introduction of fuel through a venturi means located upstream of a throttle blade during higher speed engine operation.(12) Further advantages and features of the subject invention will be more readily apparent from a detailed description of the subject fuel injection system as described hereafter, reference being had to the accompanying drawings in which preferred embodiments are illustrated."}

No. 809,087 filed Dec. 16, 1985, and entitled \"Rear Spring Actuated Brake Proportioner\", now U.S. Pat. No. 4,650,258. The sole inventor of the subject application is also the sole inventor of the prior parent applications.(3) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(4) 1. This invention relates to vehicle hydraulic brake systems and, more particularly, to a hydraulic brake system utilizing a proportioning valve which responds to the load of the vehicle to vary the braking effort produced by the rear wheel brake components.(5) 2. Prior use of a rear brake proportioning valve in a hydraulic braking system include the 1984-85 Chrysler Corporation built T-115 Van and Wagon, sold under the names: Plymouth \"Voyager\" and Dodge \"Minivan\" or \"Caravan.\" In these vehicles, a proportioning valve in the hydraulic brake system is mounted to a body member slightly forward of the rear axle and slightly to the left of the vehicle center line. A connector assembly is attached to the rear axle rightwardly of the proportioning valve. The connector includes an elongated tension type spring extending between the axle and the input of the proportioning valve. When the vehicle is lightly loaded, the relative positions of the axle and the proportioning valve produces a relatively slight extension of the spring. As the vehicle load increases, particularly near the rearward portion of the vehicle, the extension of the tension spring is increased as the vehicle body moves downward with respect to the axle. Resultantly, the spring exerts an increased force input on the proportioning valve which results in the valve directing an increased brake fluid pressure to the brake components of the rear wheels for greater rear braking effort.(6) The aforedescribed brake system operates quite satisfactorily. However, the mid-axle location of the valve and connector assembly is not always convenient on other vehicles due to space considerations and interference with the body and other components. Also, a spare tire stored immediately to the rear of the brake proportioning components and the above described arrangement results in crowding. It would be desirable to locate the brake proportioning components elsewhere to permit better accessibility of the spare tire and greater flexibility in available spare tire dimensions.(7) The subject invention which is described in more detail hereinafter concerns an improved hydraulic brake system with a relocated proportioning valve responsive to vehicle loading. The proportioning valve and related components are relocated to a more desirable position in front of the rear suspension spring. Therefore, other means are provided to sense and transmit vehicle loading.(8) The above identified Chrysler Corporation brake system is generally related to the subject invention. Other related patents are discussed hereinafter. U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,150,855 and 4,325,581 relate to a load responsive brake proportioning valve for brake systems, but are specifically designed for use with coil type suspension springs of a vehicle. In both of the devices, the brake proportioning device is configured and arranged to be mounted mostly within the central portion of the coil spring of the vehicle suspension. Both devices receive force inputs directly from the suspension spring through levers 64 and 66 in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,150,855 and through resilient or elastomeric members in the U.S. Pat.

In addition, the British Pat. No. 957878 assigned to Daimler-Benz discloses a brake proportioning system utilizing a lever pivoted at its midpoint with a first arm connected to an end portion of the leaf spring and with a second arm operating a fluid valve.(11) There are other brake proportioning devices which are generally relevant to the subject application. The following patents are in this category: U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,523,057; 3,149,886; 3,199,928; 3,512,845; 3,684,329; 2,927,916; 3,936,097; 4,060,283; 4,090,740; and 4,445,725. A common feature of these patents is a brake modifying device directly responsive to axle position. It is not believed that these patents are more relevant to the subject invention of this application than the above-described Chrysler system utilized on the T-115 vehicle.(12) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(13) It is desirable to locate a brake proportioning valve in a protected location. Such a location is found just forward of the rear wheel and adjacent the forward end portion of the rear leaf type suspension spring. At this location, the forward end of the leaf spring is pivotally connected to the sprung portion of the vehicle. In the subject application, the brake proportioning valve is mounted on the sprung portion of the vehicle. The proportioning valve includes related force input means which sense vehicle loading via the angular position of the adjacent spring end. Thus, as the vehicle load increases, the spring end pivots through an arc as the sprung portion of the vehicle moves downward with respect to the mid-portion of the spring which is maintained a substantially constant distance relative to the road surface.(14) The subject force input means for the proportioning valve includes a spring position or follower member which engages the end portion of the leaf spring a short distance from the pivotal support of the leaf spring. Thus, the spring follower is moved as the spring angulates due to changes in loading of the vehicle. The follower is connected to the force input of the proportioning valve by an extended spring-like axial connector. As the follower pivots in response to loading of the vehicle, the force input on the proportioning valve is changed via the connector. The follower is desirably maintained in close contact with the end portion of the leaf spring by a yieldable control device which also contacts the end portion of the leaf spring.(15) The aforedescribed brake proportioning system and spring follower mechanisms are adapted to accurately teach the angular pivoting of the spring end portion. It is desirable to provide a pivotal following mechanism that nearly effortlessly moves with the spring end. Significant frictional resistance to pivotal movement produces an undesirable force between the elastomeric mechanism wear pads and the spring which leads to a shorter lifespan of the device. This frictional resistance can be particularly prevalent during normal flexing of the spring caused by road surface irregularities during travel.(16) Accordingly, the subject improved mechanism utilizes a low friction bearing housed in an insert mounted housing to significantly reduce undesirable frictional events.(17) Also disclosed in the subject application is a system for pre-adjusting the spring follower mechanism and brake proportioner. The system utilizes a yieldable connector with a heavy spring and a lighter spring between the proportioner valve input"}

Consequently, the connector will correctly establish the desired relationship between the spring follower and the force input of the proportioner.(18) Consequently, an object of the invention is to provide an improved vehicle brake proportioning system including a load responsive input means for a proportioning valve which directly senses angular movements of the vehicle rear leaf type suspension spring and moves nearly effortlessly with the rapid spring movements caused by road irregularities.(19) A further object of the invention is to provide an improved vehicle brake proportioning system utilizing load responsive input means to a proportioning valve which input means is moved by pivotal action of the leaf type rear suspension spring as the vehicle load changes. The resultant positioning of the load responsive input means exerts a force input to one end of an axially yieldable, dual spring connector, the other end of which directs an input force on the proportioning valve. Adjustment means including a spacer block to compress the lighter spring of the two permits the assembly to be installed on a lightly loaded vehicle and, subsequently, to be removed, thus establishing desirable relationships between portions of the system."}

As discussed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,256,292 issued Mar. 17, 1981 to Sullivan et al, jounce bumpers are of two main types. The first type is a generally convoluted tube-like member in shape formed of elastomer or rubber material. Convoluted bumpers function by a progressive stacking of the convolutions to provide resistance to jounce forces. Examples of convoluted or ribbed jounce bumpers are found in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,235,426 and 4,175,770. The main disadvantage of convoluted bumpers is their low initial spring rate requiring large compressive heights.(4) The second type of jounce bumper is generally a washer-like annular member in shape employing essentially a solid mass of elastomers in straight compression. The U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,954,257 and 4,497,523 are examples of the second type of jounce bumpers which require less compressive height but present excessively high initial spring rates.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) According to the invention, a jounce bumper is provided which has the advantages of both the above-mentioned types of bumpers while obviating their disadvantages. That is, the present bumper provides less travel to dampen shocks by obviating the stack-up compressive height required by a convoluted bumper. Further, by designing a bumper that may be molded from a uniform natural or synthetic rubber material applicant's invention achieves a low cost bumper having high initial dampening together with low displacement.(7) In the preferred embodiment of the invention, a generally cylindrical shaped solid mass hub encircles the upper end portion of a shock absorber piston rod. The hub lower end portion has concentric cylindrical outer and inner integral wall sections defining an intermediate downwardly opening channel having a defined radial extent and axial depth. The inner and outer wall sections are interconnected by a plurality of axially extending and circumferentially spaced column-like bridging portions formed integral with the inner and outer wall sections. Each of the bridging portions comprise a pair of mirror image arcuate rib-like segments symmetrically disposed about a vertically extending axis. Each pair of arcuate segments define an axial blind bore having a predetermined diameter substantially equal to the radial extent of the channel. Further, each bridging portion with its contiguous inner and outer integral portions of the wall sections, define a hollow cylindrical column-like member. Thus, upon the bumper lower end initially impacting the upper end of its associated shock absorber cylindrical tube, the plurality of column like bridging portions provide a high initial spring rate that achieves initial high dampening without producing ride harshness. As the bumper undergoes progressive compaction, each pair of column arcuate segments, being of uniform thickness, radially stretch so as to form yieldable flexible columns. By virtue of the arcuate segments having a uniform thickness, they stretch to absorb impact energy without developing localized over stressed areas that lead to a reduced life cycle."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the liquid level sensing device described in the context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the liquid level sensing device is to sense the fuel level in a fuel tank for a vehicle.","context":"US-4685332-A Liquid level sensing device\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) This invention relates to a liquid level sensing device useful in a fuel tank for a vehicle, for example, to sense the fuel level therein. The subject liquid level sensing device utilizes a conductive hollow sphere which floats on the liquid surface within a vertically oriented tube. Fuel is free to flow into and out of the tube so that the level of fuel within the tube is the same as the fuel level in the surrounding tank. An elongated resistance card is mounted in the tube in a manner so that the hollow metal sphere slides along the resistance card. Another portion of the hollow metal sphere touches the opposite wall of the metal tube thereby providing a variable resistance connection between the card and the ground which is connected to the metal tube.(3) A number of prior liquid sensing devices have utilized level sensors with a floating sphere. The U.S. Pat. No. 2,305,973 to Marchment utilizes a metal ball which is buoyed by the liquid level and slides against a wire wound resistance element in the form of an elongated rod with wraps of wire thereabout. The floating metal ball is biased against the wire wound resistor by means of an electromagnetically energized biasing device so that when the electromagnet is energized, the ball is pressed against the wire wound resistance so that a liquid level reading may be taken. It is not possible with this device to continuously monitor liquid levels since the energization of the electromagnet firmly presses the metal ball against the resistance coil and prevents the ball from sliding therealong when the liquid level changes. A similar structure is also shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,260,913 to Marchment.(4) A number of patents utilize floats which are guided by stationary means as they move with liquid level changes. The following U.S. patents are of this type: U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,348,413 to Zimmerle; 3,433,073 to Kunert; 3,555,904 to Lenker; 3,813,941 to Miguel; 4,178,802 to Yamamoto. Some of the above patents utilize floats which travel along vertically oriented and elongated resistance devices. Other patents disclose the use of a plastic type resistance card device which is also used in the subject application. In this regard, U.S. Pat. No. 4,052,901 to Bjork discloses the use of a flexible plastic transducer for liquid level sensing. The flexible transducer is provided with a photo-etched pattern of electrical conductor. Similarly, U.S. Pat. No. 4,157,038 to Yamamoto utilizes a similar resistance card type transducer.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) The subject liquid level sensing device utilized a hollow metallic sphere or ball which floats on the liquid surface and is guided in vertical movement with liquid changes by the combination of a tubular metal housing in which the ball resides and a flexible plastic resistance card also contained within the tubular housing. Unlike what is known in the prior art, the floating ball slides along the inside of the tube and also against the resistance card. The resistance card is mounted in the tubular housing so as to flex the resistance card from its normal planar configuration into a curved shape thus defining a shallow channel which extends parallel to the axis of the metal tube.

Upon upper and lower upsetting die members flattening the depending strap engaged in the slotted opening the plates are permanently interlocked in a flush manner.(3) Various forms of self-clinching arrangements have been used to secure a pair of first and second members. The U. S. Pat. No. 4,370,794 issued Feb. 1, 1983 to Bien et al disclose a clinch nut and method of installing same wherein the method includes punching a rectangular opening in a panel to receive the nut pilot and ramming the nut abutment portions against the panel to deform the panel beneath the inclined pilot side faces.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) The present invention aims at providing a self-clinching fastening arrangement adapted for permanently interlocking plate-like panel members, formed from flat steel stock, in a flush manner. Accordingly, it is a first object of the invention to provide an improved arrangement for permanently interlocking a pair of sheet metal panels which is economical to manufacture allowing the panels to be self-clinched upon the panels being driven toward each other by a suitable fabrication tool(6) An upper or first panel is formed with one or more depending open loop straps pierced or lanced therefrom by a punch or other suitable tool. A lower second panel is formed with one or more raised elongated impressions each defining an elongated frusto-conical sectioned slot. Each strap is sized to engage in an associated elongated slot such that the upper panel initially rests in spaced, substantially parallel, relation on the lower panel elongated raised impression. A die or other suitable movable fabrication tool is forced down after being brought to bear in a flush manner on the upper surface of the first panel against the resistance of an aligned back-up member such as an anvil, placed flush with the undersurface of the second panel. During fabrication the upper panel undersurface is rammed against the raised impression. This initially deforms the raised impression's continuous peripheral tongue portion laterally inwardly causing the tongue side edges to engage the adjacent edges of the strap. Upon the strap contacting the anvil the tongue side edges will be tightly anchored between the strap and the upper panel with the interlocked panel working surfaces substantially flush with their associated die and anvil surfaces.(7) When a pair of straps and their associated raised impressions are placed with their principal axes at right angles the first and second panels can be located in a more precise manner, if required. Also, by employing a pair of normally related fastening arrangements, the panels are capable of being interlocked in a single relative orientation thus insuring that the panels will not be incorrectly assembled in a reverse manner.(8) Other more specific objects and advantages of the invention will become apparent when reference is made to the following description and accompanying drawings."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the invention described in the context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the invention is to provide a movable vehicle molding that is slidably mounted on a vehicle and directly connected to a bumper to move therewith.","context":"US-4695084-A Movable molding for a vehicle\n(1) RELATED APPLICATIONS(2) This application relates to Ser. No. 939195, filed 12\/08\/86.(3) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(4) 1. Field of the Invention:(5) This invention relates to a movable vehicle molding slidably mounted on a vehicle and directly connected to a bumper to move therewith. Fastening means are used for this connection which permit vertical movement of the bumper with the molding remaining stationary.(6) 2. Prior Art:(7) Government regulations have mandated that front and rear bumpers of vehicles be so constructed and mounted as not to be damaged as a consequence of low speed impact with other vehicles or fixed structure. The prevailing method for accomplishing this has been to mount the bumper onto the vehicle by means of an energy absorbing device, such as a shock absorbing structure. When the bumper is impacted at low speeds, the energy absorbing device collapses, absorbing the energy of impact. This collapse takes with it the bumper which moves toward the vehicle. After being impacted, the energy absorbing devices bias the bumper back to its normal position.(8) One problem which has been encountered in connection with such structures is the maintenance of the integrity of moldings typically provided on the fenders of vehicles adjacent to and in-line with wrap-around end portions of the bumpers which extend around the sides of the vehicles. As the bumper is moved toward the vehicle, the wrap-around end portions also, of course, move. These end portions will impact moldings which are mounted on the fenders closely adjacent thereto. If the moldings are rigid pieces, and rigidly mounted they will be damaged upon impact with the end portions of the bumper.(9) One solution to this problem has been the use of flexible moldings. When such moldings are impacted, they deform without damage. Upon retraction of the bumper after impact, such moldings may be straightened out by hand or may return to normal position as a consequence of inherent resiliency. Examples of such moldings are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,937,508 and 4,059,301.(10) It has been desired to use a molding fabricated of rigid material. Such a molding will not, of course, flex upon being impacted by an end portion of a bumper. It is necessary that such rigid molding not be damaged by the bumper upon impact. In accordance with these needs, spring mounting means, as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 06\/776,077, filed Sept. 3, 1985, are provided to permit outward deflection of the molding upon bumper movement, with the end portions of the bumper sliding beneath the molding thereby avoiding damage to the molding.(11) However, this construction has one disadvantage. There is frequently a small amount of permanent bumper set after impact. Therefore, the molding has to be offset from the bumper a short distance so that it can return to its initial position after the bumper retracts to a position which is closer to the molding than the initial position of the bumper because of the small amount of permanent bumper set. This requires a short empty space or gap to be provided between the adjacent ends of the molding and bumper. This gap is considered to be aesthetically objectionable.(12) In accordance with another approach as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 06\/911,545, filed Sept. 25, 1986, the molding is provided with a spring urged, telescoping extension adjacent the bumper. This permits limited reduction in molding length upon impact of the bumper with the molding prior to deflection of the molding. Any permanent set of the bumper is taken up by the telescoping extension. This permits the molding to be mounted closely adjacent to the bumper end with no gap between these elements. However, this construction does require a spring assembly.(13) In accordance with the present invention, a slidable molding is provided with a simple cam arrangement which causes the molding to deflect over and pass"}

The molding is directly connected to the bumper, thus leaving no gap therebetween. Novel fastening means are used for this connection to promote ease of assembly and permit vertical movement of the bumper while the molding remains stationary. Thus, if the bumper is moved up or down upon impact, it will not damage the molding.(14) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(15) A movable molding for a vehicle having a body and a bumper mounted on one of the forward and rearward ends thereof is provided. Energy absorbing structure mounts the bumper to the vehicle. The energy absorbing structure biases the bumper to a normal position but permits movement of the bumper toward the vehicle upon impact. The bumper has an end portion extending around a side of the vehicle body.(16) The molding comprises a relatively rigid element having an underside and exterior side. The molding lies on the exterior of the vehicle body in alignment with, and adjacent to, the bumper end portion. Fastening means secure the molding to the bumper end portion. Slide element means are connected to the vehicle body. One of the slide element means and molding have projection structure thereon and the other of the slide element means and the molding has longitudinally extending recess means thereon. The projection structure is received within the recess means and maintains the molding in position relative to the vehicle body while permitting the molding to slide in the direction of the bumper movement. The bumper end portion is adapted to move the molding on the slide element means when the bumper is moved toward the vehicle upon impact and move the molding back to its original position upon retraction of the bumper end portion after impact.(17) The molding has at least one block element on the underside thereof. The block element has the recess means formed therein. The slide element comprises a structure including an enlarged head and a stem. The recess means defined by the block element comprises an elongated vertically extending recess which receives the head and an elongated horizontally extending recess communicating therewith through which the stem extends.(18) The fastening means comprises a fastening element extending from the interior of the molding through an open end provided in the molding and opening means provided in the bumper end portion. A base is slidably mounted on pin means the ends of which extend therefrom. The fastening element is secured to the base. A bracket is positioned within the molding and is capable of limited sliding. The bracket has opening means receiving the pin means to pivotably and slidably mount the base to facilitate orientation and passage of the fastening means through the opening means in the bumper end portion. The base can slide on the pin means to permit independent vertical movement of the bumper end portion."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the fuel inlet assembly described in the context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the fuel inlet assembly is to provide support for a fuel delivery inlet and its filter, including a fuel pump in the tank if desired. It also includes a fuel return for returning excess fuel to the tank and a drain conduit for selectively removing fuel from the tank.","context":"US-4706707-A Fuel inlet assembly\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) There are many designs of fuel delivery assemblies for vehicle fuel tanks. Typically, the wall of the tank has an access opening provided for insertion of the fuel inlet assembly in the tank. The delivery assembly includes a fuel reservoir, a fuel filter, a liquid level sensor apparatus and, often, an in-tank electric fuel pump and fuel conduits. The electric fuel pump, whether in-tank or not, generally has a capacity to pump a greater flow of fuel than the engine utilizes so that a fuel return conduit is commonly provided to return a flow of excess fuel back to the fuel tank. Finally, a base or cover plate supports the aforementioned components and also covers the fuel tank access opening.(3) The above-described fuel delivery components work well when the fuel inlet is located in closely spaced relation to the fuel tank bottom wall. Modern vehicle lines often share basic components, such as the fuel inlet assemblies described heretofore. Because the fuel tanks of different vehicles often vary in dimension, such as depth, it is desirable to provide a common fuel inlet assembly which is adaptable for use with different tanks.(4) A number of patents have disclosed the general configuration described above. Namely, a typical fuel inlet assembly is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,557,144. In this patent, a fuel inlet assembly includes a fuel level indicator mechanism, a fuel inlet means and a cover or support plate. The fuel inlet is in the form of a rigid conduit and, thus, the aforesaid desirability of a flexible or resilient assembly for a accommodating tanks of varying depth is not disclosed. Another patent, U.S. Pat. No. 4,546,750, disclosed an in-tank fuel pump and reservoir assembly which includes a fuel return conduit. The fuel inlet assembly is in the form of a straight conduit which would not exhibit the required flexibility described above. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,306,844 discloses an assembly including a reservoir supported on the bottom of a fuel tank which itself supports a fuel pump and filter assembly. Lacking is a device to resiliently and flexibly bias the assembly against the tank bottom. A fuel inlet, pump and filter assembly is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 3,910,464 which discloses a resilient means of mounting the components from an access opening cover member. The resilient means do not provide the flexible downward bias described above, but instead are for the purpose of allowing upward movement of the pump from the pump seat when an application of a large upward or horizontal force is applied to the pump. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,354,905 discloses a gas distributor for a bottle utilizing a spring to hold the outlet to the bottom of the bottle.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) The subject fuel delivery assembly has an object of providing a support for a fuel delivery inlet and its filter including a fuel pump in the tank if desired. The assembly also includes a fuel return for returning excess fuel to the tank which excess is produced by an electric type fuel pump. The pump's capacity is generally large and fuel unused by the engine in its operation of the vehicle is returned. In addition, a drain conduit may be provided to selectively remove the fuel from the tank, such as when the tank is to be removed from the vehicle. Another reason for the drain is for supplying fuel to a motor home generator engine. It could also be used to remove any water in the tank. The drain conduit, or if none, a fuel return may be formed in a helical fashion between a support member which also supports the fuel pump or fuel inlet. The return conduit is formed of metal tubular material and establishes a yieldable connection between the support and the fuel inlet. This biases the fuel inlet against the bottom of the fuel tank thereby providing a less vibratory and more efficient fuel pick-up assembly.(7) The fuel delivery assembly is adapted for insertion through an access opening i"}

No. 3,675,289 issued July 1, 1972 to Mark and assigned to the same assignee as the present application, discloses a method and apparatus for manufacturing piped covering materials for upholstery and the like. The Mark patent concerns the formation of substantially parallel slits in riser material, the pleating or pressing of the fabric into slits to form pipes and the sewing of the fabric to the riser on the backing at the bottom of each of the slits. The U.S. Pat. No. 3,520,755 issued July 14, 1970 and U.S. Pat. No. 3,701,707 issued Oct. 31, 1972 disclose apparatus for making heat-sealed articles with heat and tear seal seams.

The photocell source projector and detector are positioned on either side of a web supporting plate. The projector light source is normally blocked by being unable to penetrate both the foam material of the web and the overlying cover panel. Thus, the light is unable to pass through an aperture in the web plate for reception by the photocell detector.(14) Upon the web being intermittently advanced the photocell arrangement senses the passage of the cover panel trailing edge by virtue of the light source penetrating the exposed web portion intermediate the panels for reception by the photocell detector. The resultant change of state by the sensor energizes an electronic counter driven by a train of pulses emitted from a web travel sensing encoder which reads the revolutions of a web chain drive sprocket. The counter is emperically preset such that after receiving a predetermined number of pulses from the encoder it will cause the counter to stop the web chain advancement thereby positioning the sensed panels' trailing edge coincident with the cutting die upstream border. It is a feature of the invention that because the sensor senses each panel's trailing edge the panels may be manually positioned on the web with unequal longitudinal spacing between the panels. The placement of the panels sole requirement is that a predetermined minimum distance be provided between the panels so as to allow the photocell sensing means sufficient time to reset the counter prior to the arrival of the next panel."}

This invention relates to a cup holder which is formed as an integral component of a vehicle interior trim panel so as to minimize space requirements and be aesthetically compatible with the vehicle interior.(4) 2. Brief Description of the Prior Art(5) Accessory supports such as cup holders are well known but are presently found in the form of add-on housings as opposed to an integral part of the vehicle interior. Such presently available devices are bulky and detract from the appearance of the vehicle interior. U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,136,461 and 3,267,567 are representative of such add-on units, and disclose devices which are visually unpleasing and require careful alignment in assembly within the vehicle to insure proper fit. Since they are separate, i.e., not built into the vehicle interior, the devices require individual fasteners, part numbers and strong vehicle support attachment such as floor pan tunnel support.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) An integrated body interior trim panel is provided having means for supporting one or more beverage containers. The cup holder is constructed to minimize space and weight requirement, present a pleasing \"built-in\" appearance in contrast to an \"add-on\", and yet provide more than adequate means to securely restrain the container from accidental spillage.(8) The cup holder of this invention is provided by providing a recess or opening in the trim panel by which to accommodate a housing which supports two panel members. One of the panel members is pivotally hinged adjacent its lower edge to a lower portion of the housing and is movable between a cup holder stowed position in which the panel lies substantially flush with the surrounding trim panel to an open position in which the panel pivots outwardly from the trim panel. The first panel is dimensioned to substantially close the trim panel opening when the cup holder is in its stowed position and can be provided with an ornamental or decorative finish to complement the remaining interior trim members. Pivotally joined to this first panel is a second panel with the two panels being interconnected by means of a hinge adjacent the top of both the first and second panels. The lower portion of the second panel is provided with guide rollers which are received in slots formed in the vertical walls of the housing. In operation, normal movement of the first panel causes the second panel to move from a stowed position in which it is behind and parallel to said first panel to an open or cup supporting position in which the said panel projects generally horizontal and outward from the trim panel."}

Field of the Invention(3) This invention relates to a collapsible\/expandable shipping rack having an erected configuration and a storage configuration. The end walls are expandable both horizontally and vertically to alter the size of the rack.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) In modern manufacturing, it is common practice to assemble completed units at a single location from various parts and components which are shipped to the assembly location from other locations. The parts and components are normally fabricated in facilities remote from the assembly location and shipped to the assembly location in containers. Two problems have arisen in connection with prior art containers. One type of container which has been in common use in the past is the throw-away container. Such containers are fabricated of materials such as cardboard and low grade wood. Throw-away containers have presented a serious disposal problem at assembly plants. Additionally, such throw-away containers are not available in units of sufficient strength to ship heavy parts and components.(6) Reusable racks fabricated of heavy duty steel have been in common use in the past. Such racks are strong in construction and are capable of retaining heavy parts and components. These racks have had the disadvantage of being expensive to transport empty back from an assembly location to the location of the origin of parts and components for refilling and reshipment.(7) Collapsible racks have been suggested to reduce the volume of empty racks for reshipment. However, collapsible racks fabricated of steel have still suffered from the disadvantage of being quite heavy which involves expensive reshipment costs. Also, such collapsible racks have suffered from a low return ratio. The return ratio is the ratio between the volume of a fully erected container and a collapsed and stored container. Further, such racks made of steel have suffered a rust problem. Prior art racks have also been of a fixed size thus requiring an extensive inventory of rack sizes to suit the various differently sized parts and components.(8) In accordance with the present invention a collapsible rack is provided which has a relatively high return ratio, the return ratio being approximately 3:1. Further, the rack is fabricated of a combination of plastic and light weight aluminum materials thus reducing the weight substantially, for example, illustratively from over 1000 pounds for a dunnage rack 106 inches long by 48 inches wide and 41 inches high. A similar rack made in accordance with the present invention has exterior dimensions of 96 inches by 51 inches by 51 inches and weighs approximately 360 pounds. Furthermore, the end walls of the rack are expandable both vertically and horizontally to permit variation in the interior rack size thus facilitating loading the rack with variously sized parts and components. For example, the rack may be loaded with automotive gas tanks which vary considerably in size from those used on smaller vehicles to those used on larger vehicles. The rack size can be tailored to the particular size of the gas tanks being shipped.(9) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(10) The collapsible\/expandable shipping rack comprises a generally rectangular bottom wall having a pair of oppositely disposed end walls.

Field Of The Invention(3) The purpose of the subject invention is to provide a data communication network for providing communication of parametric data between microprocessors and\/or microcomputers. Although the particular embodiment described grew out of experiences in the automotive environment, such a bus could be adaptable to a variety of non-automotive applications, also. Although the interface integrated circuit developed is capable of supporting many types of higher level communications protocols, such as master-slave or token passing, it is primarily useful in a collision detection network.(4) 2. Description Of The Pior Art(5) The demand for linking of isolated intelligence incorporated in microprocessors and microcomputers in various stand-alone equipment is well known.(6) Some solutions used to link the isolated intelligence of microprocessors and microcomputers include Local Area Networks (LAN). LANs link several microprocessors or microcomputers, each of which can take control of the serial data channel and transmit data to any other unit. Some of the problems of LANs are complex protocols, controllers and software, and the need for more complexity in larger systems.(7) In smaller applications which link several microprocessors or microcomputers within a relatively small area, a much less complex performance than is supplied by a typical LAN is needed to handle the throughput of a small number of microprocessor or microcomputer controlled units.(8) Known in the art is a digital data bus designed to handle the above-described level of performance. Such a digital data bus system is described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,429,384 to Kaplinsky issued on Jan. 31, 1984, \"Communication System Having An Information Bus And Circuits Therefor\".(9) Some of the major differences between the prior art noted above and the subject invention is that the prior art uses speed shifting and the subject invention operates at a constant speed. Another difference is that the prior art utilizes an acknowledged bit from the receiving station whereas the subject invention does not. As such, the subject invention does not require a tight link between the transmitting station and the receiving station(s) which would require that the receiving station(s) respond during a message transmission.(10) The heart of the subject invention over the prior art is the simplification of the communication link between message transmitter and message receiver.(11) Another thing added over the prior art to the subject serial data bus, is the interconnection with a serial communication interface (SCI) port.(12) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(13) The subject communications bus is a two wire differential signal system in which several user microprocessors are connected to the bus, in parallel, through a bus interface IC. All user microprocessors connected to the bus can receive all messages sent on the network. User microprocessors with messages to send follow a simple set of rules to arbitrate for the use of the bus.(14) All user microprocessors operate independently of each other. User microprocessors can be set up to only receive, only transmit or both receive and transmit messages.(15) This system is flexible and easily expandable. User microprocessors can be added and deleted with little or no impact on the operation of the bus or the other microprocessors on the bus other than that due to message volume or message protocol.(16) The bus operates at a predetermined baud rate and the bus interface IC depends on an externally supplied clock signal. Pin selectable clock divide options are available.(17) All messages on the bus use the following format:(18) message ID byte 1; message ID byte 2; . . . message IC byte N; data byte 1; data byte 2 . . . data byte N.(19) The message ID byte(s) is(are) a unique value that identifies the message and is(are) the first byt"}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the message ID byte(s) in the bus communication system?","groundtruth":"The message ID byte(s) is(are) a unique value that identifies the message and is(are) the first byte(s) of the message transmitted. It enables the collision detection system to select the winner during bus arbitration.","context":"byte 1; message ID byte 2; . . . message IC byte N; data byte 1; data byte 2 . . . data byte N.(19) The message ID byte(s) is(are) a unique value that identifies the message and is(are) the first byte(s) of the message transmitted. At least one message ID byte is needed. The simultaneous transmission of the message ID bytes from several user microprocessors occurs during bus arbitration and the unique message ID values enable the collision detection system described herein to automatically select during arbitration one of the several transmitting users as the winner and, therefore, current user of the bus.(20) A given message is normally transmitted by only one user microprocessor on a given bus.(21) Messages are normally received by all user microprocessors on the bus and may be processed by one or more user microprocessors. User microprocessors may, after having received the message ID byte(s) of a message, decide that the message is not needed for their operation. The user microprocessor may then elect to wait for the next message ID byte(s) and, therefore, not take up the time necessary to receive any data bytes that may be transmitted with the current, not needed, message.(22) Data bytes and\/or a message parity byte are optional and depend on the given message being transmitted.(23) A message parity byte is a byte that is transmitted during the data byte portion of the message and is used to check the correctness of the message ID bytes and other data bytes in the message.(24) There are no inherent limitations on the length of messages sent over the bus, but the anticipated usage of the bus for automotive communications requires only messages with lengths of one to six total bytes including the message ID byte and an optional message parity byte with most of the messages having lengths of two or three bytes.(25) All bytes are transmitted on the bus in an asynchronous format: start bit first, 8 data bits (least significant bit first) and a stop bit at the end using asynchronous non-return to zero (NRZ) coding. The start bit is a logic zero and a stop bit is a logic one.(26) The bus 26 is biased by pull-up resistor 58 and pull-down resistor 59 at a level approximately one-half the value of the difference between + and - sources. See the External Bias Circuit in FIG. 3.(27) The collision detection bus interface IC can support various modes of interface to the user microprocessor. The mode described herein is that of a serial communications interface (SCI).(28) The SCI mode is designed to interface the bus to the SCI facilities normally available in microprocessors (i.e., two wire, full duplex, asynchronous, byte\/character orientation, medium speed).(29) Generally, during message transmission, while a byte is being transmitted to the bus, its reflected byte is simultaneously being received.(30) It is an object of the subject invention to simplify the point-to-point message format of state-of-the-art serial data buses by changing it to a broadcast message format. This means that the heart of simplification is the elimination of a word to identify the originator of the message and another word for the identification of the destination of the message. Instead of this point-to-point format, a message ID bytes is used to identify the data being transmitted or the information being communicated. In some cases, the message will consits of a message ID only. In other cases, the message ID will identify the data that follows the message ID. If need be, point-to-point format can still be accommodated.(31) It is an additional object of the subject invention to provide an SCI port as a part of the serial data interface IC."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the programmed spark scatter control method?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the programmed spark scatter control method is to provide quick response to changing load conditions.","context":"US-4719573-A Programmed spark scatter control method for quick response to changing load conditions\n(1) BACKGROUND AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(2) Most conventional idle speed control systems involve servo-control of engine airflow either with a movable throttle stop or with an air bypass valve. There is a relatively long delay between any change in airflow and the corresponding change in idle speed. Therefore, the controller must have a fairly high degree of damping to maintain stability, and the response of the system to changing load conditions is rather slow.(3) Particularly with low idle speeds, desirable for low fuel consumption, there is a danger of the engine stalling with the sudden application of a load or combination of loads, such as the air conditioning compressor, power steering or alternator.(4) In these systems, if an attempt is made to speed up response by reducing the damping, over-shooting and oscillations in engine speed may occur. These conditions are objectionable by themselves, and may also result in stalling.(5) In addition, if the airflow is increased too suddenly, delays in fuel response and intake manifold fuel accumulation effects may cause transient disturbances in the fuel air ratio which can aggrevate the stability problem.(6) By temporarily changing the spark advance in response to idle speed changes due to changing engine load, either by retarding or advancing the value, the idle speed can be quickly moved back to the targeted value and held there until the air bypass system has a chance to catch up. As the air bypass valve is properly positioned, the spark advance is slowly changed back to its steady state value. This strategy allows the automatic idle speed actuator valve or motor to operate in such a manner that the system is very stable without the undesirable effects of slow response.(7) Although particularly well suited for control in an air bypass system, such a method can also be used in conventional carbureted engines and in throttle body injected engines and in multipoint fuel injected engines, all with movable throttle stops to control the spark advance in the same manner as herein described."}

The use of extreme testing conditions requires that the heat dissipation be adequate enough not only to handle the normal running conditions of the circuit, but also to handle the greater than normal heat conditions encountered during testing.

Field of the Invention(3) This invention relates to a tray for transporting internal combustion engine pistons. The tray is reusable. The tray includes first and second concentric pockets for receiving pistons having different diameters.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) In modern manufacturing, it is common practice to assemble completed units at a single location from various parts and components which are shipped to the assembly location from other locations. The parts and components are normally fabricated in facilities remote from the assembly location and shipped to the assembly locations in containers. Internal combustion engine pistons have commonly been transported in relatively large containers wherein the pistons are stacked in layers and separated by means of corrugated cardboard dividers, commonly with the further use of corrugated sheets between the layers. The use of corrugated cardboard has provided protection against damage to the pistons, portions of which are highly finished. However, this practice has not resulted in efficient space utilization and has resulted in a disposal problem, it being necessary to dispose of the corrugated cardboard material as the containers have been emptied of pistons.(6) In accordance with the present invention a reusable tray for transporting internal combustion engine pistons is provided. The tray is fabricated of a plastic material which is of relatively high strength but has a relatively soft and smooth surface and is flexible. Suitable plastic is, for example, a high impact styrene. The construction of the tray is adapted to prevent scratching, gouging or like damage to pistons during storage and transport. Pistons are fabricated as machined items and it is desired not to damage the machined surfaces. In particular, it is highly desirable not to damage the highly finished surfaces of the piston which are the bearing surfaces for mounting the connecting rod wrist pin. The tray of the present invention provides separation of the pistons and also provides a smooth surface for contact with the pistons which will not abrade or otherwise damage the piston surfaces. The tray is reusable and thus does not involve a disposal problem at assembly points. The reusable nature of the trays results in ultimate lower costs. The construction of the trays makes maximum utilization of space.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) A tray for transporting internal combustion engine pistons is provided. The tray comprises a generally rectangular tray body having a bottom wall. A plurality of spaced apart generally cylindrical first pockets extend downwardly from the bottom wall. Second pocket sidewall structure extends upwardly from the bottom wall concentrically around each of the first pockets to define a plurality of spaced apart generally cylindrical second pockets extending upwardly from the bottom wall.(9) The juncture of the sidewall structure with the bottom wall is spaced a short distance from each of the first pockets to define a first generally cylindrical shelf adapted to support a piston. The first pockets include a sidewall structure and a bottom wall. A second generally cylindrical relatively narrow shelf is provided at the juncture of the first pocket sidewall structure and bottom wall. The second shelf is spaced from the first pocket bottom wall and adapted to support a piston.(10) The diameter of the first pockets is less than the diameter of the second pockets whereby pistons having one diameter are receivable in the first pockets and pistons having a second larger diameter are receivable in the second pockets. Both the second pocket sidewall structure and the first pocket sidewall structure are angled inwardly of the pockets from the upper to the lower portions thereof to facilitate easy insertion and extraction of pistons.(11) The second pocket sidewall structures between sets of four second"}

The clip is intended to contact the inner surface of the shield panel allowing the button to be manually reciprocated over an elongated opening in the panel. The stem portion has its free end open to receive the tongue portion of a manually activated release lever for a seat back adjust mechanism. An example of such a prior art seat latching mechanism is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,634,180 issued Jan. 6, 1987 to Zaveri et al. Such prior art metal clips have been found to interfere with the smooth travel of the button. Also, such prior art metal clips may fail or come loose thus rendering the button inoperative.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) It is an object of the present invention to construct a button retainer in such a manner that the aforementioned disadvantages are avoided.(6) The present expedient of a manual adjust button retainer requires no major modification of the mechanism. The present invention presents a simple retainer design which is readily installed to achieve smooth button travel while insuring positive retention during the service life of the seat structure.(7) Accordingly, the retainer means of the present invention is in the form of a rectangular frame member made from plastic material. The frame member is defined by a pair of spaced apart side elements interconnecting a pair of spaced apart end elements providing opposed parallel internal faces. The frame member is dimensioned for slidable reception on a rectangular sectioned stem member extending through an elongated opening of a plastic shield panel covering a seat back adjust mechanism. The mechanism includes a release lever having a tongue portion positioned adjacent the elongated opening on the inner side of the shield panel. The stem portion free end is open and sized to receive therein the tongue portion such that reciprocal movement of the button causes the stem portion to swing the tongue portion so as to pivot the release lever thereby disengaging the seat back adjuster.(8) The frame member includes a pair of lugs formed in opposed relation on the inner faces of each of its pair of side elements or lugs. Further, each side element is formed with a convex-shaped arcuate runner which runner extends towards the fixed end of the stem portion. The stem portion is box-sectioned with its open free end defining edge positioning slots located to accommodate the insertion of an associated side element lug to permit each lug to be inserted in its associated slot when the frame member is fitted on the stem portion open end. Each of the positioning slots has a predetermined dimension such that with the lugs fully inserted on their associated slots the runners are positioned in juxtaposed relation to the inner surface of the shield panel. The frame member is fixedly secured to the stem portion as by sonic welding or heat staking whereby the button is retained on the shield panel for smooth reciprocal travel by virtue of each runner sliding adjacent one side edge of the elongated opening."}

Prior Art(5) In modern manufacturing, it is common practice to assemble completed units at a single location from various parts and components which are shipped to the assembly locations. The parts and components are normally fabricated in facilities remote from the assembly location and shipped to the assembly location in containers. Two problems have arisen in connection with the use of prior art containers. One type of container which ha been in common use in the past is the throw-away containers. Such containers are fabricated of such materials as cardboard and low grade wood. Throw away containers have presented a serious disposal problem at assembly plants. Additionally, such throw away containers are not available in units of sufficient strength to ship heavy parts and components.(6) Reusable bins fabricated of metal and plastic have been in common use in the past. Such bins are strong in construction and are capable of retaining heavy parts and components. Such reusable containers have had the disadvantage of being expensive to transport empty back from an assembly location to the location of the origin of parts and components for refilling and reshipment. In accordance with the present invention a collapsible bin is provided which has a small collapsed configuration, is fabricated of plastic to be lightweight yet has a rugged construction.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) The collapsible bin comprises a generally rectangular bottom wall, four side walls and a top wall. The bottom wall has upstanding wall structure along each edge thereof. First bottom wall hinge structure is provided on the upstanding wall structure along one edge of the bottom wall. Second bottom wall hinge structure is provided on the upstanding wall structure along a second adjacent edge of the bottom wall. The second hinge structure is positioned at a higher vertical level than the first hinge structure. Third bottom wall hinge structure is provided on the upstanding wall structure along a third adjacent edge of the bottom wall.

Fourth bottom wall hinge structure is provided on the upstanding bottom wall structure along a fourth adjacent edge of the bottom wall. The fourth hinge structure is positioned at a higher vertical level than the third hinge structure.(9) Sidewall hinge structure is provided on the lower marginal edge portion of each side wall. Hinge connecting means pivotally secure each of the first, second, third and fourth bottom wall hinge structures to one of the side wall hinge structures whereby the side walls are hingedly secured to the bottom wall at successively higher vertical levels starting from the side wall secured to the first bottom wall hinge structure.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the headlight door actuating mechanism in a vehicle?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the headlight door actuating mechanism is to open and close the doors covering recessed headlights of a vehicle.","context":"US-4737893-A Headlight door actuating mechanism\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) 1. Field of the Invention:(3) The invention relates to a mechanism for actuating the doors covering recessed headlights of a vehicle to the open and closed positions.(4) 2. Prior Art:(5) Mechanisms for operating the doors of recessed vehicle headlamps to open or close have been widely used in the past. Such mechanisms are shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,324,742, Voorhees, June 20, 1943; 2,700,725, Morphew et al, Jan. 25, 1955; 3,070,687, Marchant, Dec. 25, 1962; and 3,601,594, Carbary, Aug. 24, 1971. The headlight doors shown in these patents have been, broadly, symmetrical about a vertical axis so that it has been possible to open and retract the doors into the headlight recess in a relatively straightforward manner.(6) However, in the present invention, the headlight door is not symmetrical about a vertical axis. It is desired, from a design standpoint, to provide the door in the form of a non-right angle parallelogram. This has been done for design effect. The headlights are recessed into vehicle panel structure which is angled rearwardly from the front of the vehicle towards the side of the vehicle or, from an inboard point of the vehicle to an outboard point of the vehicle. This has been done so that when the front end of the vehicle is viewed from the front of the vehicle, the headlamp doors will give the optical illusion of being rectangular. Because of the slant of the panel structure in which the doors are mounted, if the openings were actually rectangular, they would appear to be non-right angle parallelograms when viewed from the front of the vehicle. This is considered to be visually objectionable.(7) However, as a consequence of this arrangement, the doors are not symmetrical about a vertical axis. This geometry results in making it impossible to retract the doors about an axis which is perpendicular to the side edges of the door and at the same time to fully retract the doors into the recesses. A portion of the doors would always project out of the recesses if the axes of retraction were at right angles to the edges of the doors. On the other hand, if a horizontal axis were chosen, the doors would move in a sideward direction with respect to the side edges of the opening into which they are mounted during the retracting process. This would cause interference of the side edges of the doors with the side edges of the openings as the doors are retracted. In order to solve this problem, in accordance with the present invention, the doors are retracted about a horizontal axis so that they will be entirely recessed into the headlamp recesses when they are retracted. But, during the retracting process, the doors are simultaneously moved sidewardly so that they will not interfere with the edges of the openings in which the headlamps are recessed.(8) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(9) The headlight door actuating mechanism of the present invention is provided in a vehicle which has front and body panel structure defining a pair of openings. A pair of headlights are recessed in the openings. Each opening is closed by a pivotal door when the headlights are turned off.

Examples of such shock absorbers are shown in U.S. Pat. No. 4,046,403 issued Sept. 6, 1977 to Yoshido and U.S. Pat. No. 4,482,135 issued Nov. 13, 1985 to Ishida et al.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) In accordance with the present invention, there is provided a shock absorbing strut adapted for use in a vehicle independent suspension comprising an upright strut apparatus having a strut outer support casing enclosing a shock absorber. An inner cylinder, fixed in the support casing, has a hydraulic dampening fluid therein. A valved piston is mounted in the cylinder for sliding reciprocal movement relative thereto and includes a piston rod operatively connected to the piston. The piston rod, extending through the upper end of the cylinder and support casing, has its upper end fixed to an upper mounting assembly attached to a sprung body portion of the vehicle. The upper mounting assembly comprises a collar member having an upstanding annular collar portion extending through an opening in the vehicle sheet metal body. The collar lower end is formed with a radially outwardly extending contact flange adapted for attachment to the vehicle sprung mass such as the underside of the sheet metal body structure.(6) The upper mounted seat assembly includes an inverted cylindrical cup member having an upper closed end body portion and a lower open end neck portion. The cup upper body portion is positioned in concentrically spaced relation within the collar portion defining an annular space therebetween. The cup upper body portion and lower neck portion are joined by an integral reverse-bend stop flange. The stop flange extends radially so as to underlie a portion of the collar flange in an axially spaced manner with the vehicle in its statically loaded state. A flexible elastomeric cylindrical shaped isolator is bonded intermediate the outer collar portion and inner cup body portion. A convoluted elastomeric sleeve, having its upper end fixed to the cup neck portion, extends axially a predetermined distance so as to surround the upper end of the strut outer casing with the suspension strut supporting the vehicle in its statically loaded state.(7) The cup member is diametrically and axially sized to telescopically accommodate the upper end of the outer support casing for dictated amounts of stroke during oscillation dampening caused by wheel jounce and rebound. As the oscillating deflections or jounce travel increases an outer support casing, in one form of the invention, includes a contact ring which engages the convoluted sleeve. The sleeve convoluted portion yields until the sleeve has folded upon itself for initial loading between the contact ring and the cup member stop flange thus providing jounce bumper cushioning of the strut. For maximum jounce travel the folded sleeve is compressed intermediate the support casing contact ring and the cup member stop flange causing axial resilient deformation of the elastomeric isolator. In the event the isolator is subjected to excessive axial displacement the cup member stop flange will abut the collar flange. This feature provides a predetermined axial travel stop limiting the upward displacement of the isolator. At the strut's minimum compressed height the support casing upper end is designed to contact the cup member closed end prior to the convoluted sleeve being excessively deformed and overstressed between the contact ring and stop flange.(8) In an alternative embodiment of the in"}

It will be noted that in this embodiment a convoluted elastomeric tube is connected between the cup member and the support casing while functioning solely as a protective dust shield.(9) A feature of the present invention is to significantly lower the overall height of a hydraulic shock absorbing suspension strut at full compression by providing an upper mounting assembly adaptable for a vehicle having a reduced hood line without changing the suspension characteristics of the vehicle.(10) It is another feature of one form the present invention to provide a vehicle shock absorber strut upper mounting assembly wherein a convoluted jounce bumper is adapted to additionally function as a dust and splash shield.(11) Still another object of the present invention is to provide an upper seat mounting assembly for a shock absorber strut wherein both an elastomer isolator and a jounce bumper provide elastic cushioning while positive compression travel stops prevent excessive deformation or overloading of both the isolator and jounce bumper thereby increasing the service life of the mounting assembly."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the invention described in the context?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the invention is to provide a movable vehicle molding that is slidably mounted on a vehicle and directly connected to a bumper to move therewith.","context":"US-4753467-A Movable molding for a vehicle\n(1) RELATED APPLICATIONS(2) This application relates to Ser. No. 06\/939,195, filed Dec. 8, 1986.(3) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(4) 1. Field of the Invention(5) This invention relates to a movable vehicle molding slidably mounted on a vehicle and directly connected to a bumper to move therewith. Fastening means are used for this connection which permit vertical movement of the bumper with the molding remaining stationary.(6) 2. Prior Art(7) Government regulations have mandated that front and rear bumpers of vehicles be so constructed and mounted as not to be damaged as a consequence of low speed impact with other vehicles or fixed structure. The prevailing method for accomplishing this has been to mount the bumper onto the vehicle by means of an energy absorbing device, such as a shock absorbing structure. When the bumper is impacted at low speeds, the energy absorbing device collapses, absorbing the energy of impact. This collapse takes with it the bumper which moves toward the vehicle. After being impacted, the energy absorbing devices bias the bumper back to its normal position.(8) One problem which has been encountered in connection with such structures is the maintenance of the integrity of moldings typically provided on the fenders of vehicles adjacent to and in-line with wrap-around end portions of the bumpers which extend around the sides of the vehicles. As the bumper is moved toward the vehicle, the wrap-around end portions also, of course, move. These end portions will impact moldings which are mounted on the fenders closely adjacent thereto. If the moldings are rigid pieces, and rigidly mounted they will be damaged upon impact with the end portions of the bumper.(9) One solution to this problem has been the use of flexible moldings. When such moldings are impacted, they deform without damage. Upon retraction of the bumper after impact, such moldings may be straightened out by hand or may return to normal position as a consequence of inherent resiliency. Examples of such moldings are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,937,508 and 4,059,301.(10) It has been desired to use a molding fabricated of rigid material. Such a molding will not, of course, flex upon being impacted by an end portion of a bumper. It is necessary that such rigid molding not be damaged by the bumper upon impact. In accordance with these needs, spring mounting means, as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,629,232, issued Dec. 16, 1986, are provided to permit outward deflection of the molding upon bumper movement, with the end portions of the bumper sliding beneath the molding thereby avoiding damage to the molding.(11) However, this construction has one disadvantage. There is frequently a small amount of permanent bumper set after impact. Therefore, the molding has to be offset from the bumper a short distance so that it can return to its initial position after the bumper retracts to a position which is closer to the molding than the initial position of the bumper because of the small amount of permanent bumper set. This requires a short empty space or gap to be provided between the adjacent ends of the molding and bumper. This gap is considered to be aesthetically objectionable.(12) In accordance with another approach as disclosed in U.S. patent application Ser. No. 06\/911,545, filed Sept. 25, 1986, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,685,712, issued Aug. 11, 1987, urged, telescoping extension adjacent the bumper. This permits limited reduction in molding length upon impact of the bumper with the molding prior to deflection of the molding. Any permanent set of the bumper is taken up by the telescoping extension. This permits the molding to be mounted closely adjacent to the bumper end with no gap between these elements.(13) In accordance with the present invention, a slidable molding is provided with a simple cam arrangement which causes the molding to deflect and pass over outwardly of the projecting vehicle body structure without"}

The molding is directly connected to the bumper, thus leaving no gap therebetween. Novel fastening means are used for this connection to promote ease of assembly and permit vertical movement of the bumper while the molding remains stationary. Thus, if the bumper is moved up or down upon impact, it will not damage the molding.(14) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(15) A movable molding for a vehicle having a body and a bumper mounted on one of the forward and rearward ends thereof is provided. Energy absorbing structure mounts the bumper to the vehicle. The energy absorbing structure biases the bumper to a normal position but permits movement of the bumper toward the vehicle upon impact. The bumper has an end portion extending around a side of the vehicle body.(16) The molding comprises a relatively rigid element having an underside and exterior side. The molding lies on the exterior of the vehicle body in alignment with, and adjacent to, the bumper end portion. Fastening means secure the molding to the bumper end portion. Slide element means are connected to the vehicle body. One of the slide element means and molding have projection structure thereon and the other of the slide element means and the molding has longitudinally extending recess means thereon. The projection structure is received within the recess means and maintains the molding in position relative to the vehicle body while permitting the molding to slide in the direction of the bumper movement. The bumper end portion is adapted to move the molding on the slide element means when the bumper is moved toward the vehicle upon impact and move the molding back to its original position upon retraction of the bumper end portion after impact.(17) The molding has opening means in the end thereof adjacent to the bumper end portion. The bumper end portion has opening means therein. The fastening means comprises a flexible cable including tension means extending through the opening means in the molding and the opening means provided in the bumper end portion. The cable is secured at one end to the molding and at the other end to the bumper. The tension means is preferably a coil spring. The cable is in tension so as to place the molding in abutting relationship with the bumper end portion but accommodating vertical movement of the bumper end portion upon impact, with the molding remaining vertically stationary.(18) The slide element means includes a first bracket fixedly fastened to the vehicle body at a point adjacent to the end of the molding remote from the bumper end portion. Projection structure extends outwardly from the first bracket. A second bracket is secured to the molding. The second bracket includes an elongated slot structure which slidably receives the projection structure of the first bracket. A first portion of the slot structure is closely adjacent to the end of the molding remote from the bumper end portion and extends longitudinally with respect to the molding so that the molding will slide only longitudinally upon first being moved by the bumper end portion. A second portion of the slot structure extends from the first portion at an angle towards the vehicle body and bumper end portion so that the end of the molding remote from the bumper end portion will slide longitudinally and away from the vehicle body after the first movement of the molding."}

The U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,873,496 to Elms; 3,084,211 to Rapata; and 3,425,725 to Givot et al. are examples of prior art edge connector assemblies.(4) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION(5) According to the present invention a novel one-piece plastic screw anchor or retainer member is provided which is resiliently collapsed by the user's fingers for ready insertion in a panel edge cut-out. Upon its release the retainer snaps back to its original shape locking the retainer in the cut-out with its central bore adapted for receiving a screw element. The retainer central bore comprises opposed arcuate wall segments interrupted by living hinge gaps defining, with integral bridging portions, a pair of opposed living hinges. One living hinge is formed by a arcuate web portion bridging its associated gap while the other gap is bridged by a wedge-shaped portion comprising tapered leg segments terminating in a lead-in nose portion.(6) The retainer is sized for insertion of the wedge-shaped portion in a panel edge cut-out defined by intersecting vertically and horizontally extending slot portions. The vertically extending slot portion has an upper open end interrupting the panel upper mating edge. The horizontally extending slot portion portion defines an upper pair of stop edge segments together with a pair of vertically extending opposed side edges spaced horizontally a predetermined distance. Upon the retainer body portion being flexed inwardly about its opposed living hinges the arcuate bore segments assume an oblong or oval shape. This narrowing of the body portion allows cam shoulders formed by the tapered leg segments to pass through the cut-out horizontal slotted portion until flange sections of the channel portion contact one side of the panel.(7) Release of pressure on the retainer body portion causes the arcuate wall segments to resume their normal shape As a consequence the cam shoulders contact the opposite side of the panel fixing the retainer in the cut-out with the principal axis of the retainer central bore aligned with the horizontally extending slot major axis. The central bore is adapted to threadably receive a screw element extending through an aperture in a horizontal plate-like workpiece for securing it to the panel mating edge. As the screw is turned it draws the retainer body portion upper surface against the cut-out stop edge segments thereby tightly securing the workpiece to the panel upper mating edge.(8) A further feature of the invention is that with the screw element threaded in the body portion bore arcuate segments the cam shoulders cannot be forced toward each other thus mechanically locking the retainer in the panel cut-out.(9) Still another feature of the invention is that the arcuate segments defining of the retainer body portion central bore may, by either formed with smooth opposed surfaces sized to receive a self-tapping screw element or formed with screw element internal mating threads."}
{"question":"What is the purpose of the invention?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the invention is to provide an improved gear synchronizer clutch mechanism that will produce an accelerated shift sequence for a given shift time interval.","context":"US-4770280-A Snap-action arrangement for transfer case synchronizer\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) This invention relates to a gear synchronizer shift arrangement for motor vehicle transmissions and more particularly to such an arrangement which may be incorporated into a vehicle transfer case for a four wheel drive vehicle.(3) It is known to use a transmission type strut synchronizer clutch arrangement to provide on the go two-wheel to four-wheel drive mode shifting for a transfer case drive assembly. An example of one such arrangement shown and described in S.A.E. Technical Paper Series No. 800002, entitled \"Internal Transfer Case Controls for Four Wheel Drive Vehicles\" by G. E. Huffaker, dated Feb. 25, 1980, discloses a part-time transfer case gear synchronizer clutch. The transfer case provides a two-wheel drive operating state wherein the main shaft directly drives a tubular extension which, in turn, drives the rear axle output shaft through a gear connection in the inter-axle differential. A fork mechanism shifts a synchronizer clutch sleeve into engagement with external splines of a silent chain carrier placing the transfer case in its four-wheel drive mode delivering power via a drive chain to the vehicle front drive shaft. In such a synchronizer shifting operation there may be a slight manual or mechanical induced time delay or slippage in the shifting sequence resulting in lagging travel of the shift fork apparatus. In the event of such slippage the synchronizer sleeve internal splines are unable to advance smoothly to initially engage the chain carrier splines without some undesirable shifting resistance and\/or gear noise.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved gear synchronizer clutch mechanism which will produce an accelerated shift sequence for a given shift time interval.(6) It is further an object of this invention to provide an improved gear ratio synchronizing mechanism wherein the lagging travel of a shift rail fork resulting from the rotation of a transfer case cam plate, having a cam track against which a cam follower bears, is compensated by means of a spring-assisted shift fork apparatus.(7) Motion from a shift selector is suitably transmitted from a cam plate directly to a pin on an outer bracket of a shift fork apparatus slidable mounted on a shift rail. The shift fork apparatus, which in turn operates a gear clutch synchronizer, is adapted to slide on the rail for reciprocal travel between a two-wheel drive position and a four-wheel drive position. The cam plate may be rotated either manually by means of a shift lever or automatically by suitable power means such as, for example, a vehicle remote switch controlled electric drive motor.(8) A fork arm has an axially extending tube member defining forward and aft tube portions. A U-shaped bracket is slidably mounted on a shift rail by means of aligned apertures in its forward and aft side flanges. A first coil compression spring is concentrically disposed about the forward tube portion intermediate the bracket's forward flange and the shift fork arm. The first spring operates to constantly bias the shift fork tube member rearward into spaced relation with the bracket forward flange. A second coil compression spring is concentrically disposed about the shift rail intermediate the bracket aft flange and the transfer case housing. The second spring operates to constantly bias the bracket aft flange forwardly into abutment with the fork aft tube portion. The dual spring biasing arrangement thus provides rapid lost motion movement instantly advancing the synchronizer clutch sleeve into its initial locked condition from the synchronizer indexed position upon the blocker ring being unloaded. Thus, the shift sequence is smoothly completed by allowing passage of the synchronizer sleeve spline tooth to full lock-up engagement with the chain carrier spline teeth."}

Ledger cards had been used for keeping account of each loan, including information concerning the debtor, information concerning the repayment of each loan, and information concerning attempts, when necessary, to notify and inquire of the debtor in the event that his loan repayments had been delinquent. With the advent of computerized data processing apparatus, many of the aforementioned financial tasks have been facilitated by entering some of the financial data mentioned above into computerized data banks from which that data may be readily retrieved. However, in many systems, hard copies (i.e. printed documents) of each loan transaction, loan history and updated information had been used to keep account of each loan. Furthermore, although individual systems have been developed and have been used to implement individual ones of the various operations that are used for financial loan accounts, there has been no suggestion prior to the instant invention of integrating all of these individual operations and functions into a single centralized system. For example, the processing and history of loan payments might be implemented in a data processing system, but that system is not useful with another system by which lease processing and accounts are maintained. Similarly, histories and details of collections and attempts to collect loans generally have not been stored in electronic data processing systems. Rather, such information relating to loan collections usually is stored in the form of \"hard copy\" of paper documents.(4) Still further, some data processing systems which have been used to process and keep account of various loans are not of the so-called \"real-time\" or on-line systems. Rather, such prior systems process information that is gathered during the day in a so-called \"batch\" mode during off hours. Consequently, neither a customer (or debtor) nor an operator of the data processing system would be aware of two or more transactions that are made by that customer during a day.(5) One example of a prior art system which suffers from the disadvantages mentioned above and which is not operable to integrate all of the desired financial loan processing and accounting functions is the CLASS system which had been developed for FinanceAmerica Corporation of Allentown, Pa.(6) OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION(7) Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a centralized financial data processing system which avoids the aforenoted disadvantages of prior art systems, which integrates various individual loan and financial processing and accounting systems, and which provides various functions and operations not available heretofore.(8) Another object of this invention is to provide a central processing system and method of operating that system, in which a data bank provided at a central processor is used to store relevant financial loan information, the data bank being updated in real time.(9) A further object of this invention is to provide a financial data processing system which utilizes a host computer coupled, via suitable communication channels, to various distributed processors, such as mini-computers, each mini-computer being connected to one or more offices, and each office containing one or more terminals for accessing and updating financial loan information that is maintained at both the host computer and respective ones of the distributed processors connected thereto.(10) An additional object of this invention is to provide a financial data processing system in which restrictions ar"}

A central processor includes a data bank into which data is written and from which data is read, that data including financial loan information representing, inter alia, the balance of respective loans outstanding, the interest rates payable on those loans, the principal and interest due and payable for respective, periodic loan payment, the identities of the respective customers (or debtors) and the various delinquencies of payment on the respective loans. The data bank also includes information representing laws and regulations of individual state governments which control and regulate the various parameters of loans, such as interest rates, durations, maximum amounts lendable, qualifications of debtors, and the like.(14) Plural terminals are coupled to the central processor, each terminal having an input means, such as a keyboard, and a display means, such as a video display terminal (VDT). Each terminal is operable by an operator to write into the data bank updated financial loan information and to access the financial loan information stored therein. Preferably, only those operators with predetermined authorizations, as determined by various identity codes, are permitted to update or change the financial loan information stored in the data bank. The central processor is suitably programmed to recognize such authorizations.(15) In accordance with one desirable aspect, the input means is operable to enter into the data bank multiple loan payment data representing principal and interest payments and the identities of respective debtors for a batch of loan payments. As a numerical example, loan payments on twelve separate accounts may be entered in a single batch, each of those loan payments being credited as to the payment of interest, principal and other charges. Such multiple loan payment processing facilitates the payment by mail from customers of bank credit cards, lines of credit, secured or unsecured loans, mortgage payments, lease payments, and the like.(16) As another aspect of the financial data processing system of the present invention, the input means is operable by the operator to enter a loan application data into the data bank, this loan application data representing the identity of each applicant, the amount, type and duration of the requested loan, the interest rate payable on the requested loan, and credit data representing the applicant's ability to repay the requested loan. The stored loan application data is utilized in the event that the applicant requests subsequent loans, leases or other transactions implemented by the financial data processing system. Such loan application data also is usable by an operator of the system when making inquiries of customers whose loan repayments may be delinquent. Such loan application data also is utilized by supervisory personnel in determining whether an applicant's credit qualifications are satisfactory and whether various loans and\/or leases are to be approved or rejected.(17) The display means included in the aforementioned terminal are operable to display data sto"}

Other preselected summaries also may be displayed upon suitable input requests from the input means, such as the profitability of various loans, the quantity of loans in different categories, and demographic data that is indicative of various profits, losses and volume of various financial products that are processed and accounted for by the financial data processing system.(18) In accordance with one aspect of this invention, the central processor comprises a host computer coupled, by means of conventional communication channels, to distributed processors, such as mini-computers, located in regions spaced from the host computer. Each mini-computer may be connected to one or more regional offices, and each office may include one or more of the aforementioned terminals. The host computer serves as a back-up and archive for the financial records utilized by the mini-computers in processing and keeping account of the financial data used by those offices to which the respective mini-computers are connected. The host computer communicates with the various mini-computers in real time, such that updated financial data that is written into a data bank at a mini-computer is transferred, in real time, to the data bank located at the host computer. Preferably, but not necessarily, changes in state laws and regulations may be made at the host computer; and such changes subsequently may be transmitted, if needed, to the mini-computers.(19) One or more terminals may be connected to the host computer; and the host is programmed such that an operator at one of those terminals may communicate with a mini-computer as if the host is \"transparent\". One advantage of utilizing distributed mini-computers resides in the fact that the overall financial data processing system is capable of continued operation even in the event of a malfunction at one or more terminals, offices or mini-computers. Likewise, in the event of a significant malfunction at the host computer, the data banks provided at each mini-computer nevertheless permit those mini-computers to continue operation.(20) In a preferred embodiment, each display means is provided with a multi-colored VDT, such as an IBM Model 3279 display. This colored display provides alphanumeric information of different colors, one color representing predetermined headings, categories or titles to identify information associated therewith, another color indicating an erroneous entry of data or an error message in the event of an erroneous entry, yet another color representing information which, once entered, cannot be varied during normal operation of terminal, such as the identity of a customer, the duration of a loan, the initial principal of that loan, and the like, and yet another color which indicates data that normally is entered and updated at a terminal, such as the amount of a loan payment, the date on which that payment is made, etc.(21) Still another desirable feature of the present invention is the use of menu processing. That is, the central processor is programmed to provide a display of a menu of all of the financial transactions that may be processed at a terminal.

{"question":"What is the purpose of an oil pressure transducer in automobiles?","groundtruth":"The purpose of an oil pressure transducer in automobiles is to measure the oil pressure and produce a corresponding indicator signal.","context":"US-4778956-A Pressure transducer with switch\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) An oil pressure transducer is used with internal combustion engines in automobiles to measure the oil pressure and to produce a corresponding indicator signal. There have been a variety of designs for such pressure transducers many of which utilize a diaphragm, one side of which is exposed to a pressurized fluid such as the oil of the lubricating system. An design object is to provide a simple, compact yet reliable device. In addition to measuring and indicating oil pressure, modern automobiles also typically utilize a fuel injection type system for the engine which includes an electric motor to power a fuel or gasoline pump. In some instances, it is desirable to incorporate an electrical switch mechanism in the pressure transducer for controlling the fuel pump in response to oil pressure. Specifically, it is desirable to maintain the fuel pump motor in an inactive condition until a minimum oil pressure is reached.(3) A number of United States patents generally disclose a pressure transducer and switch mechanism, either singularly or in combination. For example, U.S. Pat. No. 3,321,594 to Reise discloses a fluid pressure actuated switch with a diaphragm sensor operatively associated with electrical contacts for controlling an electric fuel pump motor. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,255,630 to Hire also discloses an electrical switch which is responsive to fluid pressure to control a fuel pump motor. The U.S. Pat. No. 4,524,255 to Haag discloses a switch with a movable diaphragm responsive to fluid pressure to open and close contacts of an electrical circuit.(4) The U.S. Pat. No. 4,581,941 to Obermann discloses a fluid pressure transducer including a switch therein adapted to control a fuel pump motor and utilizes a diaphragm and contacts.(5) Several other patents have been uncovered which disclose pressure transducers without the switching device. These include U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,504,324; 4,449,112; and 4,452,202. All of the patents discussed or identified heretofore broadly disclose a pressure transducer with or without a switching mechanism but do not specifically disclose the desirable features in the fluid pressure transducer with a switching device as described hereinafter.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) It has been recognized from the patent disclosures identified above that a pressure transducer utilizing a diaphragm which is movable in response to fluid pressure changes is known. Likewise, the utilization of a diaphragm generally to move contacts is also well known. Likewise, the use of the aforesaid diaphragm movements to measure and indicate fluid pressure for producing an electrical indicator signal is known.(8) The subject pressure transducer and switch assembly incorporates desirable design features to better monitor and indicate fluid pressure. Specifically, the housing of the transducer encloses a piston like member movable along with a diaphragm's mid portion in response to pressure changes. The piston also carries an electrical contact bearing assembly which engages a resistor board supported by a separate terminal support member. The terminal support member is adjustably and insertably attached to the transducer housing and is removable therefrom as a unit for servicing or the like. The terminal support member is inserted into the transducer housing to an extent which determines the pressure indicating calibration and thus the electrical indicating output.(9) The subject transducer and switch assembly also includes a desirable switch design for a fuel pump motor including a switch contact bar which is yieldably held in a normally closed contact with conductors in the transducer housing.

One example is found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,320,824 issued May 23, 1967 to P. H. Riley, Jr. et al. The Riley patent concerns a gear mounted on a splined shaft wherein tolerance accumulations may cause slight angular misalignments between the mating splines inducing vibratory noises during operation. Riley discloses noise-suppressing cushioning O-rings encircling the gear supporting shaft on either side of the gear. The O-rings are held under axial compression between the gear and a suitable retaining element such that the O-rings are deformed into firm engagement with a side face of the gear and with the shaft. The O-rings function to define a space to trap lubricant between the gear and the supporting shaft such that a film of lubricant is maintained to minimize metal-to-metal contact.(4) The U.S. Pat. No. 2,867,130 issued Jan. 6, 1959 to K. G. F.

Michling discloses a speed reducer drive yieldingly mounting the output end of a central gear within the hollow shaft of a planet gear carrier of the output stage by means of resilient elements providing transverse limiting of movement. These elements are positioned and arranged such that upon removal of the load from the drive gear of the system, the resiliency or restoring force of the elements effect centering of the shaft journals of the central gear against the weight thereof.(7) The U.S. Pat. No. 3,408,830 issued Nov. 5, 1968 to A. Sutaruk et al discloses a torsion drive assembly wherein a rubber grommet has its inner periphery press fitted onto a torsion shaft sleeve. The rubber grommet functions as a dampener and aids in dampening the noise due to impact or shock loads imparted to the drive assembly as well as serving to maintain the sleeve concentric with the longitudinal axis of the torsion shaft. This maintains radial space therebetween and thus prevents rattling and fretting wear between the mating splines as the input member and the torsion sleeve.(8) The U.S. Pat.

As a result the reverse idler gear teeth run in preloaded meshed condition relative to both the output shaft and counter shaft reverse gear teeth into the forward drive modes when the reverse gears are not transmitting drive torque. Thus, backlash gear rattle between the reverse gear meshed teeth is obviated in the forward drive modes.(12) It is still another object of the present invention to provide an improved vehicle manual transmission reverse idler gear shaft assembly mounting arrangement as set forth above wherein one end of the idler shaft is resiliently mounted in a transmission housing midship main plate bore and its axially spaced flange portion bore by means of resilient O-rings adjacent the thrust head and shank end portions of the idler shaft assembly thereby obviating reverse gear idler shaft assembly vibrations from being transferred from the midship mounting plate to the transmission housing.(13) A further feature of the invention involves an reverse idler gear shaft assembly mounting arrangement as set forth above wherein a predetermined variable-center positioning of the ends of the reverse idler shaft shank and head portions is provided in oversized aligned bores by elastomeric O-rings.

This results in the intermeshed teeth of the three reverse gears being in predetermined designed driving relationship for transferring reverse torque from the counter shaft to the output shaft via the idler shaft assembly. Thus, applicant's invention obviates excessive tooth wear, such as spalling, at the mating faces of the meshed reverse gear teeth during the reverse drive mode of the transmission."}

The construction includes means for hiding the heads of the threaded fasteners from external view.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) In modern car construction, it is desired to hide the heads of any screws which are used to attach tail light assemblies to a vehicle. It is considered aesthetically undesirable to have externally visible fasteners on the exterior of vehicles. One technique which has been used in the past to attach the tail light assemblies in place without the fasteners being externally visible has been to provide interior screws which are set from inside the space behind the tail light assembly. However, in some vehicle designs, it is either impossible or very inconvenient or expensive to provide for such interior screw mounting.(6) In the present invention, means have been provided for first fastening the tail light assembly to a vehicle using fastening means which are initially externally visible. A cover plate is provided which is then latched on one side to the tail light assembly and screwed into the tail light assembly from the other side. However, the screw means are not visible from the exterior of the vehicle because they extend from the deck lid opening into the tail light assembly. When the deck lid is closed, the heads of screws cannot be seen. Thus, a relatively inexpensive technique has been provided for achieving the desired end of making the fastening devices not externally visible while avoiding the necessity for setting screw means from a point behind the tail light assembly.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) The combination of the present invention comprises a vehicle body having a tail light opening and a deck lid opening which is adjacent thereto. A deck lid is mounted on the vehicle body over the deck lid opening. The deck lid is adapted to swing to open and closed positions with respect to the deck lid opening. A partition is provided between a tail light opening and the deck lid opening. The partition defines an inboard wall of the tail light opening and an outboard wall of the deck lid opening. The deck lid obscurss the adjacent surface of the partition when it is in the closed position and permits access to the surface when it is in the open position.(9) A tail light assembly is received in the tail light opening. The tail light opening has an upper wall. Latch structure is provided on this upper wall. Cooperating latch structure is provided on the upper end of the tail light assembly in latching engagement therewith.(10) The tail light assembly has a lower wall with opening means therein.

The wall sections are interconnected by a plurality of integral column-like arcuate bridging segments defining therebetween an axial blind bore. Upon the bumper being impacted the wall sections together with the bridging segments stretch to absorb impact energy thereby achieving the initially high dampening load displacement resistance.

{"question":"What is the purpose of the instrument panel structure described in the invention?","groundtruth":"The purpose of the instrument panel structure is to reduce injury to vehicle occupants by absorbing energy during impacts with the head or knees.","context":"US-4805924-A Instrument panel structure for an automotive vehicle\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) 1. Field of the Invention(3) An instrument panel structure for a vehicle is provided. The panel structure includes an energy absorbing panel member fabricated of a relatively rigid impact resistant resinous material modified so that one portion gives more readily under impact than do other portions.(4) 2. Prior Art(5) Increasing attention has been paid in recent years to the provision of instrument panels for automotive vehicles which will tend to reduce injury to vehicle occupants as a consequence of impact with the instrument panel on the occurrence of sudden decelerations caused by accidents or rapid braking action.(6) Instrument panels are subject to two different types of vehicle occupant impact. One type of impact involves doubling over of the occupant whereupon his head will impact the instrument panel. Head injuries are, of course, very serious and it is desired to provide an instrument panel which, when impacted by an occupant's head, will give and absorb energy of impact in a manner to ease impact forces.(7) The other type of impact is with the vehicle occupant's knees against the lower portion of the instrument panel. While it is, of course, desirable to protect the knees from injury, there is another problem associated with such impact. The lower portion of the body is heavier than the upper portion. When the knee contacts the instrument panel it means that the lower portion of the body is moving forwardly. It is desired to prevent such forward movement within the constraints of minimizing knee injury in order to protect the vehicle occupant from more severe injury which may be caused by such forward movement of the lower body portion. Therefore, the lower portion of the instrument panel should not give as much as the upper portion.(8) The difference in the two types of impacts has resulted in an instrument panel designed problem. If the panel is constructed so as to give under lower impact forces so as to protect the head, it will also give under relatively low knee impact forces which is undesirable. The reverse proposition is true, that is, if the instrument panel is made more rigid so as to not give under knee impact forces, it will not give sufficiently under head impact forces.(9) One solution to this problem which has been proposed is to weaken the joint interconnecting the upper and lower portions of the instrument panel so that the instrument panel will, in effect, bend under head impact forces. A reinforcing element may then be provided on the lower instrument panel portion to prevent movement of the lower portion. The various ways this might be done present manufacturing problems which have been difficult to overcome.(10) In accordance with the present invention, the lower portion of the instrument panel is made sufficiently strong so as to properly resist knee impact forces. The upper portion of the panel is embossed on the reverse side to result in a plurality of protuberances which are spaced apart from each other. This has weakened the upper portion of the panel sufficiently to permit it to give under the head impact forces in a desired manner. The result is a one-piece instrument panel structure which serves both the needs of energy absorbing for head impact and energy absorbing for knee impact.(11) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(12) An instrument panel structure is provided for an automotive vehicle. The panel structure includes an energy absorbing panel member fabricated of a relatively rigid impact resistant resinous material. The panel member includes an upper portion and a lower portion. The two portions are interconnected.

The upper portion has an inner surface. A plurality of spaced apart protuberances are provided on the inn"}

The protuberances cause the upper portion to more readily give under such impact forces and absorb the energy of impact in a manner tending to reduce head injury.(13) The lower portion has an inner surface and an outer surface, the inner surface of which is protuberance-free whereby it is more resistant to giving under impact so that when the lower portion is subjected to vehicle occupant knee impact on the outer surface thereof it will impede forward movement of a vehicle occupant.(14) A plurality of spaced apart protuberances may also be provided on the outer surface area of the lower portion adjacent to the upper portion to weaken this area of the lower portion so that it will bend more readily upon vehicle occupant head impact with the upper portion. The instrument panel member is preferably fabricated as a single unit whereupon protuberances may be provided on the outer surface of the interconnecting portion to assist in the weakening process. The purpose of this weakening is to facilitate ready bending of the upper portion upon vehicle occupant head impact.(15) In a preferred embodiment, the panel member is about 4\/32 of an inch thick between the outer and inner surfaces and the protuberances are about 1\/32 of an inch thick.

{"question":"What is the purpose of a motion transducer?","groundtruth":"The purpose of a motion transducer is to accurately transmit the pressure level of oil in the engine with a device of simple construction with few parts and great reliability.","context":"US-4806901-A Motion transducer\n(1) BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION(2) It has long been desired to produce a simple device which transmits linear motion of one member directly into rotary motion of another member. This is particularly desirable in an oil pressure transducer as used in vehicles with internal combustion engines. The object of a device of this kind is to accurately transmit the pressure level of oil in the engine with a device of simple construction with few parts and great reliability.(3) An early pressure indicator is disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 1,171,480 to Troll. In the Troll patent, a linear moving member attached to a diaphragm transmits the linear movement to rotary movement by means of a lever and gear arrangement. The mechanism is relatively complex as opposed to the subject device to be described hereinafter.(4) Another relatively early device is shown in U.S. Pat. No. 2,877,327 to Hastings. The Hastings device utilizes a movable diaphragm member responsive to liquid pressure. The diaphragm member includes a linearly movable portion with an axial aperture therethrough. A pin with a spiral channel formed therein moves in the aperture and is rotated by means of a follower which extends into the channel. While producing rotary movement directly from linear movement, the Hastings patent provides an entirely different structure than the subject device.(5) Other patents known to applicant are as follows: U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,086,557; 2,943,302; 2,286,717; 4,449,113; 3,160,014; and 2,525,095. None of the aforementioned pressure indicators of transducers utilize the structure of the subject device to be described hereinafter.(6) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(7) The subject pressure transducer includes a mechanism for directly transmitting linear motion of one another into rotary motion of another member. Specifically, force is produced on a diaphragm exposed to oil pressure of an engine which causes the midportion of the diaphragm to move away from the oil. A member adjacent the diaphragm moves therewith in a linear motion. A table member is supported in a housing of the transducer and is capable only of rotary motion and has a resistor grid thereon adapted to be engaged by contacts as the table rotates. The transmission of linear to rotary motion is through a helical spring with two end portions attached to the underside of the rotary table and with the end portions extending generally in a circumferential direction near the periphery thereof. The midportion of the spring extends toward the diaphragm and is engaged by the diaphragm associated member. This member is prohibited from rotation and moves linearly in the direction towards the rotary table with pressure increases. The resultant force on the helical spring causes the end portions to progressively overlay greater circumferential portions of the rotary table while simultaneously producing rotary movement of the table.(8) From the foregoing, it can be readily understood that the subject device is a relatively simple and reliable means to transmit linear movement into rotary movement. Further advantages can be appreciated by a reading of the following detailed description of a preferred embodiment shown in the drawings as follows."}

During the welding process a consumable component, known as a welding electrode, must be maintained in the proper position to ensure a proper weld. Misalignment of the electrode occurs due to electro-mechanical erosion.(3) In resistance welding machines, the product components to be welded are clamped in proper relationship to one another and welded together maintaining the desired form. Two welding electrodes are used during the welding process, one on each surface of the product components. One electrode has a variable position to provide clearance for insertion and removal of the product components being welded. The other electrode maintains a stationary position.(4) The stationary electrode must maintain the proper position to mechanically resist the welding force and conduct the high welding currents. As welding occurs, the stationary electrode deteriorates and must be adjusted to maintain proper welding position.(5) In the state-of-art resistance welding machines, adjustment of the stationary electrode is made by unclamping the electrode, turning a bolt in communication with the electrode thereby adjusting it to proper welding position, then re-clamping the electrode in place.(6) Precise adjustment is difficult to achieve in most cases because adjustment devices cannot be reached with the product components clamped in place. Proper location of the stationary electrode resting against the surface of the product components is in question if the product components are not in place when the adjustment is made. When the variable electrode and stationary electrode are not pressing tightly against the product components, as proper adjustment would achieve, the welding forces which are calculated to create a quality weld are consumed by deforming the clamped product until it contacts the stationary electrode. This prevents a quality weld from being constructed at the prescribed schedule of current, time and force for which the machine was designed.(7) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(8) The subject invention provides an adjusting means for the stationary electrode which will allow quick and proper adjustment with the product components clamped in place. This will urge a proper weld of the currently positioned product components without distorting the metal of the product.(9) The adjusting means must be able to withstand the force of the welding electrodes. To accomplish this, the subject invention utilizes a hydraulic lock means.(10) The subject invention consists of a hydraulic system utilizing two pistons, the actuated piston which positions the stationary electrode and the motive piston which controls the hydraulic pressure on the actuated piston, thereby creating adjusting movements. The motive piston allows the adjustment to be made while the product is clamped in place. This hydraulic system can be modified to allow adjustment of the electrode to take place from a remote position by utilizing a length of conduit between the motive piston fluid chamber and the actuated piston chamber in the hydraulic system.(11) The hydraulic lock mechanism is shown in one embodiment as a bolt attached to the motive piston which is engaged in the cover over the motive piston.

An example of one such arrangement is found in the U.S. patent application Ser. No. 7\/077,272 filed July 24, 1987, entitled Attaching Arrangement for Vehicle Seat Cushion, now U.S. Pat. No. 4,742,984 to Cote et al. The Cote et al. patent discloses a vehicle seat cushion plastic anchor member adapted to be snap-fitted into a vehicle floor panel aperture by means of locking fingers. The Cote et al. anchor member is molded into a oval-sectioned tubular open-ended body with the interior of its side walls formed with parallel mutually opposed pairs of ribs defining a pair of spaced upwardly open V-shaped notches. The lower ends of each pair of ribs are interconnected by mutually opposed base flanges defining an elongated gap therebetween with each flange undersurface sloped upwardly providing an inverted V-shaped locking catch adapted to capture a seat frame striker upon the striker being forcefully pushed downwardly into the V-notches allowing the striker to snappingly pass through the gap.(4) The British Pat. No. 1,574,372 to Kuno et al., and published Sept. 3, 1980, is an example of another automobile seat fastener device comprising a plastic body having a retaining collar and retaining fingers to mount the body in a floor aperture.(5) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(6) A primary object of the present invention is to provide an improved quick connect mounting arrangement for an automotive seat structure, including a composite plastic and rubber self-sealing anchor member adaptable to be snap-fitted into position in an associated vehicle floor panel aperture by means of a self-sealing rubber ring lip flange. The composite anchor assembly comprises a synthetic resin plastic lower shall part bonded to an upper peripheral rubber seal ring part. The shell part includes a hollow socket body portion, having an oval-shaped horizontal section, molded of flexible plastic material formed with a closed lower end and an open upper end. The open upper end is operative t receive the bight portion of a U-shaped striker depending from the seat structure.(7) The shell body portion upper open end is formed with a continuous peripheral inverted U-shaped arcuate collar portion ending in an outer V-section terminal flange. The rubber seal ring part includes a stirrup-like U-shaped integral loop portion bonded to the inner surface of the plastic shell socket. The loop interior is formed with opposed wedge-shaped integral ribs defining therebetween a lead-in upwardly opening V-shaped notch providing an uniform elongated gap. The V-shaped notch is adapted to receive the bight portion of a U-shaped striker extending downwardly from a supporting portion of a seat cushion frame.(8) Upon the striker bight portion being forcefully pushed downwardly into the V-shaped notch a wedging action causes the hollow socket flexible side wall portions to resiliently bow outwardly in response to the flexing of the collar and V-sectioned spring flange allowing the striker to pass through the gap. The striker is captured by snapping it in an inverted V-shaped locking catch formed by the wedge shaped portions undersurfaces which are each slanted upwardly toward the interior of the hollow socket. It is thus a feature of the present invention to provide a composite anchor member operative to sealing inclose the striker member and vehicle body aperture obviating the passage of moisture into the vehicle.(9) Another feature of the invention is to provide an composite anchor member as set f"}

Field Of The Invention(3) The subject harness retainer stud is used generally to retain wire harnesses of conduit to an automobile body panels.(4) II. Description Of The Related Art(5) Examples of similar retainer studs are found in the prior art and are best described by referring to the following patents owned by the Click Bond Company, which is a division of Physical Systems, Inc., U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,492, U.S. Pat. No. 4,338,151, U.S. Pat. No. 4,390,576 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,668,546.(6) These references generally describe a method and apparatus for adhesively attaching self-fixturing studs or other elements to a surface (support 36 in the U.S. Pat. No. 4,302,492. The stud is mounted upon a support member which is movable between two positions. After an adhesive is applied to the stud, the support member is temporarily mounted to the surface with the stud in a first position that is out-of-bearing engagement with the surface. The support member is then moved to a second position to place the stud in bearing engagement with the surface, and a force is applied to the stud, urging it toward the surface. The support member is removed and discarded after the stud has bonded to the surface.(7) U.S. Pat. No. 4,660,546 discloses a method for rapid installation of support stud members through the use of automated or semi-automated power tool equipment. This requires a plurality of support members interconnected to each other by a breakaway runner, item number 60 in FIG. 11 of the U.S. Pat. No. 4,660,546. The automated equipment then applies the adhesive to the stud and uses a punchpress to install the support members on the surface and to press the stud into bearing engagement with the surface. The surface is carried past the installation machinery by a conveyor.(8) The prior art studs contain three deficiencies which are overcome by the present invention. First, these studs require the application of adhesive at the point of assembly. Secondly, the prior art studs require the application of pressure during the adhesive bonding stage. This requires the additional structure of the support member. Thirdly, once the adhesive has bonded, an additional step of removing the disposable support member is required. The manner in which the subject invention overcomes these deficiencies is described below.(9) The installation method disclosed in the prior art requires that the surface, onto which the stud is mounted, be moved past the punch-press. This limits the usefulness of the installation method. As will be described below, the present invention allows the stud to be moved to a location remote from where the stud is fed into the automation equipment. This allows the stud to be mounted onto interior surfaces of automobile body panels which cannot be accessed by the punch-press used in the prior art.(10) These four prior art patents are hereby expressly incorporated into this description by reference.(11) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(12) The subject retainer stud in the preferred embodiment is envisioned to be used to mount wire harnesses or conduits in automobiles and is designed to accept a stud mountable wire harness or conduit retainer clip. Both the retainer stud and the retainer clip are universal, i.e., both may be used in a variety of environments for a variety of retention purposes and the application should not be viewed as restricted merely to wire harnesses or conduits.(13) The retainer stud comprises a threaded shaft attached to one side of a flat plate. Mounted to the opposite side of the plate is a resilient annular seal, the outer surface of which is covered with a secondary contact adhesive. A primary uncured adhesive is located in the center cavity of the annular seal. The stud is held onto an automobile body panel by the secondary adhesive.

Originally, the thin metal leads of a transistor were attached to conductive tracks of a circuit board by soldering. This rigidly attached the device but made difficult its removal. Likewise, integrated circuits are commonly soldered to a board.(3) It is known to solder a receptacle to a circuit board, the receptacle having sockets formed therein to receive the leads of an integrated circuit. The resultant assembly facilitates removal of the integrated circuit.(4) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(5) The subject invention is an improved device for mounting an electrical device to a circuit board. Specifically, in automobile electrical odometer assemblies, it is desirable to removably mount an electric stepper motor on a circuit board. The stepper motor has pin-like leads projecting from one end. An elongated connector device is initially clipped onto the circuit board. A tab at one end of the connector projects through an aperture in the circuit board so as to be located adjacent a solder pad. Subsequently, the tab is soldered to the pad and thus the connector is secured to the board.(6) A bifurcated end of the connector is positioned over another aperture in the circuit board. The bifurcated end forms a pair of spaced arms adapted to receive and grip the pin of the stepper motor. This solidly mounts the stepper motor but allows it to be easily removed by the application of a force on the motor to withdraw the pin.(7) Accordingly, an object and advantageous feature of the improved connector and circuit board lies in the solid attachment of the connector to the board combined with the ease of attaching the motor to the connector while still allowing easy removal of the motor from the board."}

More specifically, the invention concerns a damping circuit to be placed between the variable resistance output of a fuel tank sending circuit and the driving input to a fuel gauge.(3) False fuel gauge indications in vehicles such as automobiles are often generated as a result of the vehicle's acceleration, going uphill or downhill, cornering or undergoing any other operation that causes the fuel to \"slosh\" about or otherwise vary in a highly transient manner. Known approaches to dealing with the \"sloshing\"problem appear to involve relatively complex arrangements such as utilization of microcomputers for averaging the analog level readings obtained from the tank sender circuit.

Field of the Invention:(3) The invention relates to a storage pack of trays loaded with semi-circular split ring bearing halves.(4) 2. Prior Art:(5) There has long been a problem associated with packaging of semi-circular split ring bearing halves. Split ring bearings of the type with which the present invention is concerned comprise a pair of semi-circular bearing halves adapted to be operatively assembled to form a complete ring bearing. In such bearings, the inner concave surfaces of the bearing halves are highly finished to form a smooth anti-friction bearing surface. In packaging the bearing halves, care must be taken to prevent contact of the inner concave bearing surface of each bearing half with portions of the other bearing half. Such contact would lead to scratching or otherwise damaging the bearing surfaces.(6) One technique which has been used in the past to package bearing halves has been to place two bearing halves in a box in back-to-back relationship so that the anti-friction surfaces will not be contacted. Such packaging has the disadvantage of resulting in a relatively large bearing package. Another technique is exemplified in U.S. Pat. No. 3,138,247 issued to G. R. Perry on June 23, 1964. In the arrangement illustrated in this patent, the bearing halves are nested together, the box having a pair of elongated tongues which extend into the interior thereof and act as dividers between the nested bearing halves to prevent contact of one half with the other. This arrangement avoids damage to the bearing surfaces. Somewhat similar packaging techniques are illustrated in U.S. Pat. Nos. 3,307,685, White; 3,342,321, Haffey; and 3,337,037, Thill et al.(7) In accordance with the present invention, a tray is provided permitting packaging of a relatively large number of bearing halves thus resulting in an economical package. The bearing halves are separated from each other in a manner somewhat similar to that disclosed in the above-mentioned patents in that a rib structure having a herringbone configuration is provided in a series of compartments which receive the bearing halves. However, other than the use of this technique, the package is substantially different than the prior art packaging structures and permits packaging of a relatively large number of bearings, for example, forty bearing halves, in one tray and provides a nesting and stacking arrangement which utilizes the structure of the bearing halves for vertical support thus permitting use of relatively thin walled plastic material to fabricate the trays. This results in a low cost construction which is at the same time durable and practical for the intended use.(8) SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION(9) A storage pack compressing at least two stacked and nested trays each loaded with a plurality of semi-circular split ring bearing halves is provided. Each tray includes a plurality of elongated compartments each comprising a bottom wall from which extends a pair of upstanding oppositely disposed end walls and a pair of upstanding oppositely disposed side walls.(10) The compartments are arranged in a row in side-by-side relationship. The upper edges of the side walls of each pair of adjacent compartments are connected. Each compartment has a row spaced apart upstanding ribs on the bottom wall thereof adjacent each side wall. Each rib in each row is oppositely disposed with respect to a rib in the other row. Each rib extends inwardly of the compartment from the adjacent side wall and is angled towards one end wall of the compartment to define a herringbone structure.
