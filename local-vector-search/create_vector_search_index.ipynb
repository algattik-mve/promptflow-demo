The clearance values listed in this document are derived from vehicle testing and/or historical data and should be used as a general guideline for initial packaging of suspension components.  Clearance conditions that are less than target should be evaluated on a vehicle-by-vehicle basis taking into account statistical build variation, load based deflection capabilities, and weather the position of the suspension, causing the condition, is reasonable for the given architecture of the vehicle.  Dynamic over-travel of suspension components is not considered when evaluating the clearance vs. the target.  The target value is intended to account for typical tolerance, build variation, and compliance based travel.  Definitions: Static = non-moving parts Dynamic (moving parts) equivalent to Kinematic (moves on suspension hard points and includes alignment) Dynamic + Compliance = moves on susp hard points and includes alignment + bushing/rubber compliance   TABLE OF CONTENTS  1  UPPER CONTROL ARM (UCA) / LINKS\\t5 1.1  Body/Wheel liner – Independent Suspension (see Figure 1 for reference)\\t5 1.2  Upper

Vertical over-travel is a dynamic event that allows the suspension to continue moving into jounce past the hard stop (metal-to-metal) of the suspension.  The amount of over-travel is mainly a function of body deflection through jounce cup and bushing compression of the LCA pivots & Shock attachment to the LCA.  As a result, additional clearance may be necessary.  If the liner is trimmed around the contour of the UCA, be sure to check clearance through the full Dynamic + Compliance  sweep (jounce, rebound, and alignment; if applicable) of the arm.  1.2  Upper Control Arm/Links to Knuckle – Independent Suspension  Clearance Target:  12.0mm Remarks:  Maintain this clearance throughout the dynamic travel of the suspension.  This includes jounce, rebound, and steer (if applicable).  1.3  Upper Control Arm/Links to Floor Pan/Body/Frame – Solid Axle Suspension (around UCA at jounce)  Clearance Target:  12.0mm Remarks:   Solid Axle Suspensions are most often used in Truck/SUV applications.  Dynamic over-travel is minimal with solid axle suspensions due to jounce cup structure (typically mounted to the frame/rail) and the lack of additional axle travel due to bushing compliance.  Additional lateral clearance may be needed due to compliance of the Track Bar system and the relative motion of the Body (mounted in rubber) to the frame (body-on-frame BOF vehicles).  1.4  Upper Control Arm/Links to Body/Frame/Axle/Cradle Attachment  Clearance Target:  12.0mm / 6.0mm (see remarks below) Remarks (General):  Be sure to check clearances throughout the dynamic sweep of the suspension attachments to determine the worst case clearance (axial, radial, and conical at the worst case suspension alignment position).  Typical bushing designs incorporate \"snubbers\" that limit axial travel of the Control Arm. Be sure to check the other control arm / bushing during a snub event. If such features are present, additional clearance may not be needed. Remarks (12.0mm): Use this value early in the program when the Dynamic + Compliance  envelope has not been developed. Remarks (6.0mm):  Use this value if the Dynamic + Compliance  envelope has been developed.  1.5  Upper Control Arm/Links to Kinematic Movements of ETRTO Max In Service plus Zero Tire (with/without chain)  Clearance Target:  12.0mm  Remarks:  Maintain 12 mm to surrounding components with relative movements to tire (Control arm, sway bar, steering tie rod, body flange, etc).  1.6  Upper Control Arm/Links to General Components, Frame, Structure, and Cradle (see Figure 2 for reference)  Clearance Target:  12.0mm/6.0mm Remarks:\\tIn general, 12mm should be maintained.  Be sure to check clearance throughout the dynamic sweep of the suspension. Include jounce to rebound sweep, roll sweep (if applicable), alignment sweep (if applicable), and the full steering sweep (if applicable).  Be sure the clearance is measured at the worst case position of both components.  Remarks (12.0mm): Use this value early in the program when the Dynamic + Compliant envelope has not been developed. Remarks (6.0mm):  Use this value if the Dynamic+ Compliant envelope has been developed   1.7  Upper Control Arm/Links to Brake Shield  Clearance Target:  6.0mm Remarks:  Clearance should be evaluated throughout the Dynamic + Compliant sweep of the control arm.

The guidelines have been developed to assess the basic metallurgical and quality requirements as they pertain to magnesium ingot(s) as feed stock (raw materials) for use in (high-pressure) die casting.  These guidelines are also intended to be used in conjunction with the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Supplier Metallurgical Survey in Annex A of this document.  In the event that a new magnesium source is under consideration, it must also meet any applicable requirements as specified in FCA materials specification MS-10675 (Magnesium Alloy Ingot for High Pressure Die Casting).  1.2  Scope  This document covers a set of guidelines that are intended to be used in the assessment and qualification of magnesium alloy ingots.  The following series of alloys in magnesium-aluminum-zinc (AZ), magnesium-aluminum-manganese (AM) and magnesium-calcium-strontium (MRI 230D) series are commonly used for automotive high pressure die cast components, such as steering wheels, steering column support brackets, air bag canisters, instrument panels, brake pedal brackets, valve covers, etc.  The magnesium–calcium-strontium alloy, MRI 230D, is used for high temperature applications.   2  REFERENCES  ; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Document Number; Shield/Designator (if applicable); Document Title; downloadable for suppliers from beSTandard/B2B; MS-10675; MAGNESIUM ALLOY INGOT OR (HIGH - PRESSURE) DIE CASTING; Y; ASTM E385; STANDARD TEST METHOD FOR OXYGEN CONTENT USING A 14-MEV NEUTRON ACTIVATION AND DIRECT-COUNTING TECHNIQUE; N; ASTM B117; STANDARD PRACTICE FOR OPERATING SALT SPRAY (FOG) APPARATUS; N; ASTM B557/B557M; STANDARD TEST METHODS FOR TENSION TESTING WROUGHT AND CAST ALUMINUM- AND MAGNESIUM-ALLOY PRODUCTS (METRIC); N; ASTM E23; STANDARD TEST METHODS FOR NOTCHED BAR IMPACT TESTING OF METALLIC MATERIALS; N    3  DEFINITIONS/ABBREVIATIONS/ACRONYMS/SYMBOLS  Fast Neutron Activation Analysis (FNAA):   A technique utilizing a neutron accelerator for determining the oxygen content in magnesium.   4  REGULATED SUBSTANCES & RECYCLABILITY  All materials, procedures, processes, components, or systems must conform to the current regulatory (governmental) requirements regarding regulated substances and recyclability.  This material can be recycled using the fluxless process to satisfy the end-of-life requirements. The recycled magnesium alloys must meet the requirements of primary virgin alloy ingot alloy.  Only Stellantis approved recyclers designated in the Engineering Approved Source (MS-10675) are qualified to recycle the cited magnesium alloys.   5  MAGNESIUM INGOT QUALIFICATION TESTING  5.1  Phase I Testing  Phase I testing must precede Phase II and Phase III of the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Qualification Process.  The Ingot supplier cannot submit samples for Phase II testing without successfully satisfying all requirements for Phase I testing.  Phase I testing investigates the condition of the material in the ingot form.  As a part of the Phase I testing, an outside independent lab conducts studio photography, fast neutron activation analysis (FNAA), chemical analysis, corrosion (salt spray and humidity), metallography, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) and image analysis.  5.1.1  FNAA Testing  The average oxygen content of each ingot tested shall not exceed 100 ppm, as measured by FNAA (Fast Neutron Activation Analysis) per ASTM E385, for AM50A, AM60B, AZ91D, and 400 ppm for MRI 230D.  The measurement of oxygen by FNAA shall be conducted on a specimen taken from each of 3 ingots per alloy with the location of the specimens as designated in Figures 1 & 2.  Other specimen configurations may be used depending on the source conducting the analysis when appropriate calibration & reference standards are utilized in accordance with ASTM E385.  Fast Neutron Activation Analysis should be conducted annually for each alloy type being produced to insure manufacturing process control is being maintained.   5.1.1.1  Location of sample for FNAA   Figure 1  -  Location of FNAA samples (side view).  The sample should always be centered horizontally in this view.     Figure 2  -  Location of FNAA samples (top view).  The sample will always be centered vertically, and may be centered horizontally in this view.  It will always be at least one-quarter-ingot length from both ends.  5.1.2  Chemical Analysis  Chemical analysis shall be performed on two samples from each of the ingots per alloy.  One sample shall be taken from the bottom center of section, and the second sample taken from the middle center of section.  Chloride analysis shall be performed on one sample from each of the three ingots per alloy (the bottom center of section).  All elemental contents shall be determined using inductively coupled plasma (ICP) emission spectroscopy, except for chloride and nickel.  Chloride shall be determined using gravimetric methods and nickel shall be determined using inductively couples plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).  A certain amount of alloying elemental segregation within the ingot is allowable.  5.1.3  Corrosion Testing  Salt spray and humidity tests shall be performed on section “C” from each ingot.  The samples should be approximately 47 mm long by 47 mm wide by 10 mm thick.   5.1.3.1  Salt Spray Corrosion Testing Protocol  The testing shall be conducted in a salt spray corrosion test cabinet certified to ASTM standard B117. The procedure shall be as following.  All surfaces rinsed with a steady stream of distilled water to remove surface contaminants. Surfaces flushed with acetone and rubbed with a clean, cotton swab saturated with acetone. Samples blown dry with clean air. Samples weighed. Samples inserted in salt spray cabinet at 95°F. Date and time recorded. Testing was stopped after 24 hours. Date and time of test termination recorded. Samples let still dry. Samples weighed. Oxide dissolved from surface using 18% chromic acid. Samples weighed.  5.1.3.2  Humidity Corrosion Testing Protocol  The procedure for the humidity corrosion testing is as following.  All surfaces rinsed with steady stream of distilled water to remove surface contaminants. Surfaces flushed with acetone and rubbed with a clean, cotton swab saturated with acetone. Samples blown dry with clean air. Samples weighed. Samples inserted in humidity cabinet at 85°F and 100% relative humidity. Date and time recorded. Test was stopped after 24 hours. Date and time of test termination recorded. Samples let still dry. Samples weighed. Oxide was dissolved from surface using 18% chromic acid. Samples weighed.  5.1.4  Metallographic Examination  Metallographic specimens shall be selected from each alloy and cold mounted in clear epoxy for metallographic examination.  All samples shall be viewed in the as-polished condition.  Optical micrographs shall be taken of representative mounts from each alloy at 200x magnification to show surface and sub-surface oxides.  Automated image analysis (IA) for oxide content shall be performed on the interior microstructure of all samples.  Twenty-five fields of 0.040 mm2 each shall be examined on each sample for a total area of 1.0 mm2.  A magnification of 500x should be used.   5.1.5  Scanning Electron Microscopy and Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy  Metallographic specimens are chosen at random for examination at 20kV and photographed the mounts in secondary electron (SE) imaging mode.  Secondary electron imaging mode provides topographical contrast.  Energy dispersive spectroscopy shall be used to determine the distribution of atomic species within various areas of observation.  The EDS system shall be operated with an atmospheric thin window, which allows detection of elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to that of boron (Z=5), in particular carbon and oxygen.  Bombardment with electrons nondestructively creates X-rays that are characteristic of the various elements on the surfaces of the samples.  Square raster SEM modes are utilized at various magnifications and analytical spots are used at high magnification to confine the analytical spots within various features of the sample.  5.2  Phase II Testing  Phase II testing must be after successful completion of Phase I of the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Qualification Process.  The Ingot supplier cannot submit samples for both Phase I and Phase II testing simultaneously.  Phase II testing investigates the properties of material in the die cast form.  Phase II testing requires tensile testing (including baseline comparison data on earlier virgin material, produced by other manufacturers) and impact testing, (again, including baseline comparison data on earlier virgin material).  5.2.1  Tensile Testing  Tensile test shall be performed on specimens that are die cast with an overall specimen geometry of ASTM B557/B557M.  The tensile specimens shall be tested in accordance with ASTM B557/B557M in as-cast condition.  Die casting flash shall be removed by minor sanding from the sample parting line before testing.  Each specimen shall be loaded in tension at a controlled strain rate of 0.5% strain/minute to 1.0% strain, at which time the extensometer can be removed if so desired (or past yield).  The test is then resumed at a crosshead speed of 0.2 inch/minute to failure.  The tensile properties of each sample shall be recorded.  The gauge elongation in 2 inches shall be determined by subsequent to mechanical testing by piecing the tensile specimen together and measuring the final gauge length.  5.2.2  Impact Testing  Charpy impact test shall be performed on cast specimens.  The samples shall be the standard Charpy length of 55 mm.  The test shall be performed at room temperature in accordance with ASTM E23, in the as-cast and un-notched condition.   5.3  Phase III Plant Tour and Inspection  Once the ingot supplier has successfully completed both Phase I and Phase II of the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Qualification Process, they are deemed “Conditionally Approved” pending such time as the Phase III plant tour and inspection can be completed.  Phase III is also intended to be used in conjunction with the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Supplier Metallurgical Survey (Annex A).  The Phase III tour and inspection is the assessment for control and material tracking from the casting process to the shipping operations.  The on-site quality controls of raw materials, equipment, process flow, traceability and containment procedures, inspection criteria, work instructions, and quality analysis are inspected.  During the plant visit the Stellantis Magnesium Ingot Supplier Metallurgical Survey (Annex A) is submitted for approval and at the end of the process the supplier is deemed “Stellantis Approved”.  The official Stellantis Approval Certificate is sent out to the supplier, thereby allowing the material to be used by any Stellantis magnesium die casting component supplier.

This standard is intended for any component that can be defined by any of the classifications defined in Table 2 and routing clearance categories in Table 3.  This standard provides recommended methods to verify adherence to the standard during the product development process.  The requirements of this standard are to be incorporated into specific Knowledge Based Engineering (KBE) tools, Digital Model Assembly (DMA) reviews, Quality audits, and other processes used to ensure proper application and function. Advanced Packaging and System & Component teams are responsible for interpretation of this standard for their components.  1.2  Coverage of this Standard  This standard covers tubing, hoses, and cables including air conditioning, brake, park brake cables, coolant, fuel, Urea, power steering, transmission oil, and washer fluid hoses, but may be used for other components as specified on the part drawing.  All components covered under this standard are referred to as “plumbing.” CS-ROUTING is limited to routing requirements, not component design requirements, unless specified in part drawings.  Exhaust routings are NOT covered by this standard (see CD.80062). Air Induction Resonators & Chambers are NOT covered by this Standard.  Requirements for electrical wiring routing can be found in CS.00050 Wiring Systems - Design and Packaging Requirements. See Figure 1.    Figure 1  -  Coverage of this Standard  Components are categorized based on their type and function. The category type and component class type direct you to the routing clearance targets provided in this standard. Class types can be: l = Rigid Static, II = Flexible Static, lll = Dynamic Routing and lV = Articulating Routing. Category types can be: A = Attached, B = Unrelated Friendly, B = Unrelated Unfriendly, C = Dynamic Component, D = To Heat Source.  1.3  Limitations on Usage  This standard does not include component design requirements, material construction, or durability.  Those requirements are covered by component performance specifications, material specifications, and design best practices.  2  REFERENCES  ; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Table 1  -  References; Document Number; Shield/Designator (if applicable); Document Title; downloadable for suppliers from beSTandard; CD.80062; Exhaust System Core Design Document; N; CD.80161; Coolant Hoses and Plumbing Assemblies; N; CS.00050; Wiring Design and Package Requirements; Y; DS-104; Vehicle Design Provisions For Shipping By Multiple Transportation Modes And Carriers; N; DS-158; Ergonomics Process Driven Design Standard; Y; MS-8253; <S>; Induction Tip Hardened - Thread Rolling - Tapping Screws; Y; MS-NA-1-7; Reflective Sleeving and Adhesive Patches - Woven/Braided Fabric or Fiberglass Bonded to Aluminum Foil; Y; MS-NA-1-8; Abrasion Resistant Sleeving - Woven/Braided/Knit Fabric; Y; MQS.M10/A7; Manufacturing Quality Vehicle Lay Out (VLO) Global VLO; N; PF.90065; Jack - Vehicle Lifting; Y; PRO-A0653; North America Product Development Global Issue Management (GIM) Process & Escalation; N; SD.00113; Powertrain Dynamic Envelope - Standard Operating Procedure; N; 08195; Global Issue Management ( Development Phase ); N   3  DEFINITIONS/ABBREVIATIONS/ACRONYMS/SYMBOLS  ; A/C; Air Conditioning; AME; Advanced Manufacturing Engineering; ARDC; Automotive Research and Development Centre; BICEEP; Body, Interior, Chassis, Electrical/Electronic, Engine Systems, Powertrain; BSR; Buzz, Squeak, and Rattle; CAD; Computer Aided Design; CFD; Computational Fluid Dynamics; DMA; Digital Model Assembly; EMEA; Europe, Middle East, Africa; FCA; Fiat Chrysler Automobiles; FEA; Finite Element Analysis; FMEA; Failure Mode Effects Analysis; GVD; Global Vehicle Development; KBE; Knowledge Based Engineering; NA; North America; NVH; Noise, Vibration, and Harshness; PF; Performance Standard; SOP; Standard Operating Procedures; TC; Team Center; TOC; Transmission Oil Cooler; VLO; Vehicle Lay Out; VSA; Variation simulation analysis    4  REGULATED SUBSTANCES, RECYCLABILITY & CYBERSECURITY  Not applicable.   5  ROUTING REQUIREMENTS  Plumbing shall be routed and supported in a manner that ensures functionality and prevents NVH issues for the life of the product while providing compliance to accommodate any relative motion between the plumbing end points or intermediate attachments.  All plumbing must be routed so as to either be sufficiently constrained or have sufficient clearance with surrounding components to prevent harmful contact.  All 3D CAD routing and packaging of plumbing is to be concurrent with associated Body, Interior, Chassis, Electrical/Electronic, Engine Systems, and Powertrain (BICEEP) designs according to Global Vehicle Development (GVD) timing.  It is critical to identify packaging space and attachment requirements sufficiently early in the design process to ensure optimal routings and attachment provisions.  If target clearances are not reached there is the need to have a buy off. The Issue Owner must have the SAQ lead (Single Agenda for Quality) create a Global Issue Management (GIMS) issue if one does not exist, see PRO-A0653 for US & 08195 Procedure for ITA.  In most cases the interfacing component Engineer that may see warranty will own the issue.  5.1  Design Requirements and Considerations to Prevent Part to Part Contact  5.1.1  Component Classifications, Part Categories and Clearance Requirements  Determination of clearance requirements is a three-step process:  From Table 2, determine the classification of the routed component based on its construction and use in the vehicle. Fuels, brakes and hydraulic steering have independent category values.  From Table 3, determine the category by assessing the relationship of the plumbing to surrounding components.  From Table 4, determine the required clearance for the Class and Category in steps A and B.  DMA target clearance requirements are intended for nominal designs in nominal positions. Vehicle clearance requirements used for on-vehicle inspection can be found in the Manufacturing Quality Vehicle Lay Out (VLO) Global VLO Standard MQS.M10/A7. The vehicle clearances are typically less than DMA clearances to allow for build variation and minimum manual deflection effort used by VLO.  In cases where clearance requirements cannot be met, a list of possible countermeasures are presented in the bottom row of Table 4 and described in section 5.4 Countermeasures for Sub-Standard Clearances  5.1.2  Dynamic Envelope Definition on Components and Routings, Isolations  Dynamic Envelopes need to be taken into account when using CS-ROUTING Standard. Dynamic Envelopes in Table 4 include:  Category C, Class lll and Class lV.  Dynamic Component Envelope (Category C): Moving components on the vehicle have a specific motion such as jounce/rebound, engine roll, tire envelope, tilt steering column, door swings, etc. Dynamic Envelopes of components must be used on CS Routing Class C application. Dynamic Envelope Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) provide the technical description for creating CAD models. SD.00113 POWERTRAIN_DYNAMIC_ENVELOPE_Standard Operating Procedure is an example.  Dynamic envelope harmonized methodology requires Engineering to generate PowerTrain Motion output file with the 70% KBE method (PTMove Macro with 24 moves at 70% metal to metal travel) as mentioned in SD.00113.  Dynamic Routing Envelope (Class III & IV): The movement of a flexible hose (Class III) is due to the engine roll. Segments of the hose can behave differently depending on the distance to the source of motion (see Figure 2), leading to different hose categorization. Generally, the behavior of a hose segment between a static and a moving point can be schematized as per Figure 2. KBE and Automotive Research and Development Centre (ARDC) is a resource (North America-based) that can provide CAD models of varying articulated proportions (Category lll & lV parts) Articulating movement of routings, such as brake hoses (Category IV), is defined through the dynamic envelope or through physical testing to verify required clearances throughout articulation over the entire range of part movement.  ‘’+ Isolation’’: Isolator compliance(s) must be quantified in either the envelope or linear addition to the DMA target (see Figure 4).  Examples include compressors, body mounts, suspension cradles, air tanks, radiators, IHX lines, air boxes, and vacuum pumps.  5.1.3  Coolant Hose Length and Sag  All coolant hoses must be routed to conform to the best practices listed per CD.80161 to avoid hose kinks or pull off due to engine motion.  Coolant hoses are flexible and need to be supported or fixed to prevent sagging per the following hose support interval requirements as per CD.80161 Best Practices Section 1.12: Sag consideration is not limited to coolant but should be considered where considerable mass is carried by the hose.  Radiator Hoses Inner Diameter (ID) of 35-38mm or 46-51mm to use support intervals of 750mm  Heater and Hot Bottle Outlet Hoses 16-20mm ID hoses to use support intervals of 500mm  Hot Bottle Inlet Hose 8mm ID hoses to use support intervals of 250mm  Where unsupported hose lengths of more than 750mm cannot comply between the engine and body, route in the most direct manner possible.  Sag and deflection values are to be accounted for based on the latest Engineering Design Practices (EDP) and “as tooled” models.

Clearance requirements are defined by plumbing rigidity and nearby component per Tables 2 and 3. Part to part contact by design is not allowed. Rubbing contact is not allowed, regardless of material. Protective countermeasures on high speed rotating conditions are not allowed.  Parts must be repositioned or constrained to achieve required clearance and avoid any potential contact condition. Design sufficient flexibility (“routing elbows”, see best practices) to allow for variation between attachment points (i.e. fuel tank to body) and for build variation where required. Where clearances cannot be met, provide protection per Section 5.4 Countermeasures for Sub-Standard Clearances Clearance to NVH silencer pads must take into account the clearance requirements in Table 4.  5.2  Unfriendly and Friendly Surfaces  In any routing situation, special consideration must be taken to assess the friendliness of nearby components. Surfaces that are deemed unfriendly require either additional clearance, or suitable protection against potential damage to the routed component per Table 3, Classes I and II, Category C.  5.2.1  Unfriendly Surfaces  Unfriendly surfaces are those that contain a feature that can be expected to cause physical damage or unintended functional consequences such as NVH or BSR issues.  Examples of unfriendly surfaces include, but are not limited to the following:  Flanges that protrude from a component and form an edge. Parting lines in cast or molded parts. Corners of parts that have a sharp enough radius (concentrated/point load) such that it can damage plumbing. Rough as-cast surfaces of sand castings that can abrade plumbing with prolonged contact or rubbing. Glass filled plastics. Convolute ends / untaped slit edges or braided sheathing used in wiring harnesses. Glass fiber padding. Bolts threads extending beyond metal surfaces. Weld expulsion / spatter  5.2.2  Friendly Surfaces  Friendly surfaces are those that tend to be smooth and have a large bearing surface that poses minimal threat to other parts that may inadvertently contact them.  Examples of friendly surfaces include, but are not limited to the following:  Sheet metal surfaces, excluding sheet metal flanges. Smooth molded plastic parts such as reservoir bottles and fender shields, excluding edges. As cast surfaces of sand castings where incidental contact is normal/perpendicular to the surface of the castings with no rubbing contact.   5.3  Clearance Evaluation  5.3.1  Digital Modeling Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria  During the design phase of a program, Digital Model Assembly (DMA) is to be used to assess compliance with the requirements of this standard per Table 4.  DMA typically considers nominal part geometry and does not consider build variation / part tolerances.  Accordingly, acceptance criteria in Table 4 for DMA are greater than for a vehicle evaluation.  5.3.2  Vehicle Evaluation and Acceptance Criteria  At the earliest opportunity, the compliance to this standard must be assessed using physical properties, including, but not limited to the first available vehicles.  In cases where designs have carryover pedigree, the carryover vehicle must be reviewed at the earliest phases of the program in order to identify areas targeted for improvement. Sub-target design clearances can exist due to variation simulation analysis (VSA) studies or Blue buy-in conditions.  Sub-target clearances and Blue buy-in conditions are to be evaluated with Vehicle Integration to ensure they are in accordance to the vehicle component clearance verification standard. A vehicle evaluation is to be conducted with reasonable force applied to the plumbing to estimate possible movement during vehicle operation per Manufacturing Quality VLO Global Standard MQS.M10/A7.  5.4  Countermeasures for Sub-Standard Clearances  Where the clearance requirements of Section 5.1 Design Requirements and Considerations to Prevent Part to Part Contact cannot be met, countermeasures can address the sub-standard clearance condition. These conditions need to be escalated to stakeholders promptly and specifically monitored on durability vehicles. The vehicle conditions must be mocked-up to be at the minimum expected build clearances.  5.4.1  Countermeasures for Category A Parts  Figure 6 below.  Attach or bundle components to each other.  This is the simplest and most reliable method for resolving clearances less than those in Table 4.  By attaching the components to each other, the potential for rubbing or abrasion is mitigated by controlling the relationship between the offending parts. Provide additional attachments. Perform design tolerance stackup to confirm that no possible contact conditions exist, even at sub-standard clearances.  This method should only be used when the parts have very well defined geometry and location.  Tolerance stackups alone are not sufficient to utilize this method.  This method is best used for machined or stamped parts or end fittings of plumbing affixed to well-defined components. Assumed tolerances used in stack-ups must be applied to production level components. It is less suitable for hoses, flexible tubes, and cables.  See Figure 6 below.   Figure 6  A protective sleeve is allowed only when sub-target clearances exist. It is not allowed for design contact or interference conditions.  Protective sleeves can be used as protection only for incidental contact.  Under no condition should the level of contact result in wearing through the protective sleeve.  Protective sleeves used for abrasion protection must conform to MS-NA-1-8, Abrasion Resistant Sleeving - Woven/Braided/Knit Fabric.  5.4.2  Countermeasures for Category B Parts  Figure 7. Separate targets exist for friendly and unfriendly component interfaces  Attach components to each other. Add additional attachments to reduce build variation and provide additional constraint. Protective sleeve allowed if adjacent to a friendly surface.  Protective sleeves used for abrasion     protection must conform to MS-NA-1-8, Abrasion Resistant Sleeving - Woven/Braided/Knit Fabric. Perform design stackups / variation simulation analysis (VSA).  See Figure 7. Countermeasures for unfriendly surfaces must use only proven methods and be validated for effectiveness on each application.      Figure  7  -  Example of VSA for Category B  5.4.3  Countermeasures for Category C Parts  The following countermeasures are preferred for Category C parts.  Category C parts are adjacent to a part or system with a definable dynamic envelope.  The part itself may have a definable dynamic envelope relative to another part.  Countermeasures are not permitted for sub-standard clearance to high speed rotating parts such as pulleys, belts, wheel and tires. Add additional attachments to reduce build variation and provide additional constraint. Protective sleeve allowed if adjacent to a friendly surface.  5.4.4  Countermeasures for Category D Parts  The following countermeasures are preferred for Category D parts.  Category D parts are near a potentially harmful heat source, such as an exhaust system component, headifold, alternator/generator, or a brake rotor.  Add heat shielding either to heat source or rigid tube.  Heat shields in the form of protective sleeves must conform to MS-NA-1-7, Reflective Sleeving and Adhesive Patches - Woven/Braided Fabric or Fiberglass Bonded to Aluminum Foil. Aerothermal clearance guideline tool or CFD analysis Perform vehicle testing to ensure temperatures do not exceed material or functional specs for the component or fluid.   6  PACKAGING REQUIREMENTS  6.1  Proximity to Heat Sources  Plumbing must be carefully routed to avoid heat sources.  Where proximity to heat sources poses a hazard to part function, adequate thermal protection must be provided.  Typical sources of heat include the following, but are not limited to:  Catalytic converters, maniverters. Exhaust manifolds and headifolds. Exhaust pipes, mufflers and resonators Exhaust DOC Exhaust Flex Pipe Exhaust SCR Turbo Charger Assemblies EGR tubes Brake rotors  North America Aero Thermal Engineering developed an Aero Thermal Clearance Guidelines tool, see Figure 8, for establishing clearances and use of heat shields between components and heat sources.  This tool can be used early in the design process to establish clearances involving heat sources. Take the tool training course (CGCW-AEROTHMCG100) to learn its capabilities.     Figure 8  -  Aero Thermal Clearance Guidelines tool example  Recommended air gap between the shield and the protected component is about 4-6 mm.  Shield type and thickness can be managed on a case-by-case basis.  Suggested shield configuration is as follows:  Single layer:  1 mm thickness Dual layer:  2 layers, 1 mm thickness for each Dual layer with an air gap; (1 mm, 4 mm gap, 1 mm) Dual layer with fiber glass: (1 mm, 3 mm fiber glass, 1 mm)  Wiring or tubing sleeves should maintain a gap of about 4 mm between the sleeve and the wire, cable or tube. Suggested materials are aluminum or fiberglass woven sleeve.  If the heat shield is to be placed on the heat source (exhaust manifold or exhaust pipe for example), the inner layer should be steel or aluminized steel.  Aluminum has a limit of 370°C (700°F). If the heat shield is to be placed on a protected component, aluminum can be used.  For multilayer heat shields, fiberglass works better than an air gap if improvement in NVH is required or if the major heat transfer mode is conduction.  All under-hood components should have materials rated at 93°C/109°C (200°F/220°F) (long term/short term) as a minimum.  When installing a heat shield around a component, attention should be made to prevent circulation of hot air around the component surface.  Gaps should be minimized unless the component itself is a heat source such as alternator or electronic modules.  If a component is exposed to multi heat source such as a combination of catalytic converter, exhaust manifold and turbo surface, a detailed CFD analysis may be required.  6.2  Road Hazards  Plumbing must be protected against road hazards such as gravel, mud, snow, uneven surfaces including off road tracks, parking curbs, speed bumps, etc.  The preferred method of achieving this is to route plumbing outside of areas where damage could occur.  Where this is not possible, protection must be provided.  This protection can be provided by adjacent body structure or other components, such as debris shielding, armor, skid plates, etc.  6.2.1  Ground Clearance  All plumbing must be above ground clearance planes regardless of tolerance condition.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) is to be used to assess compliance with the requirements of this standard. Nominal geometry is to be evaluated with minimum clearance to ground plane using the appropriate part class and part-to-part category A or B per Table 4.  6.2.2  Local Low Point  Plumbing must not be the lowest point locally.  It must be protected by adjacent body structure or other components.  Care should be taken early in the design process to account for protection of plumbing by factoring it into initial body architecture.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) is to be used to assess compliance with the requirements of this standard. Nominal geometry is to be evaluated with minimum clearance to protective structure using the appropriate part class and part-to-part category A or B per Table 4.  6.2.3  Road Blast  Plumbing must be protected from debris washing up from tires.  The preferred method is to route away from road blast zones.  These zones are directly behind the tires with line of sight to the tire tread.  The zones for the front tires include full steer.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) is to be used to assess compliance with the requirements of this standard. Nominal geometry is to be evaluated to verify that direct line of sight to tire treads does not occur.  If plumbing cannot be routed out of blast zones, it must be protected from damage by shields, armor, body structure or similar means.  6.2.4  Snow / Ice Packing  Plumbing located within the wheel must be within the swept profile of the caliper to prevent damage from snow or ice buildup.  Flexible plumbing, such as vent hoses, and jounce hoses, that are exposed to buildup of ice and snow must have adequate attachment strength to maintain end-point attachments should the ice or snow buildup increase the stiffness of the flexible hose.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) is to be used to assess compliance with regard to plumbing within the wheel end.  At the earliest opportunity, vehicles must be evaluated following durability testing which includes snowy/icy conditions with unplowed on or off road sections.  After durability testing, plumbing must function and must have attachments intact.  6.3  Chemical and Water Hazards  Plumbing must be protected from chemical hazard such as coolant overflows, drain tubes, battery trays/drains, oil drains, coolant drains, reservoir fills, bleed fittings, plenum drains, etc.  The preferred method is to route away from drain areas.  If this cannot be achieved, shielding may be required to protect the plumbing.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) and vehicle evaluations are to be used to assess, as an example, that coolant and battery acid will not drain on plumbing.  If so, reroute or provide adequate protection.  Digital Model Assembly (DMA) and vehicle evaluations are to be used to assess water management methods for the vehicle and verify that plumbing is robust to exposure of water management methods.  Torqued joints, quick connects, or other couplings should not be located in areas where water is routed.  For example, plumbing must either be robust to water draining off the windshield, or it must be rerouted out of the path.  A review of the appropriate functional and/or material specifications should be performed to ensure that the plumbing material has been validated to be compatible with the various fluids it may come in contact within its specific application.  6.4  Vehicle Towing and Lifting Requirements  Plumbing must be routed to avoid damage from approved or expected towing, tie down, and lifting procedures.  Verify adequate clearances for vehicle jacking and lifting.  Reference PF.90065, Jack - Vehicle Lifting, Section 7.8 Roll Off.  Ensure clearance for towing of vehicle.  Ensure clearance to shipping tie downs per DS-104, Vehicle Design Provisions for Shipping by Multiple Transportation Modes and Carriers: Section 2.1.4 Chocks and Clearances Section 2.2.6 Locating Tie-Down Slots for Haul Away Truck Shipment Section 2.3.3 Lashing Positions and Clearance Envelope   7  ATTACHMENT REQUIREMENTS  7.1  Clip Requirements  Clips shall be retained to the vehicle, and lines shall be retained into clips under all vehicle driving and durability requirements with regard to tightness and function for the useful life as defined by the component performance specification.  The attachments should be spaced to prevent any contact to adjacent components resulting from normal flex or movement.  When selecting and positioning clips, the following must be considered: Avoid release of clips as assembly plant end items. Always try to use an existing clip/bracket. Design clips and/or brackets so that they can only be installed one way. To prevent the chance of galvanic corrosion, do not use rubber coated clips unless necessary for NVH abatement. If rubber clips are used, the clip must have an electrical resistivity of greater than 10 megaohms when measured from the shortest path between the point of metal contact to the plumbing. Parking Brake Cables should be attached to the body using conventional P-Clips and cable ferrules. Ferrules permit minimal cable movement to accommodate cable deflection during parking brake actuation.  Attachment spacing will vary by plumbing component type and location on the vehicle.  In general, the smaller the diameter of plumbing, the shorter the distance between clips.  Conversely, the larger the diameter, the greater the clip spacing.  Special attention must be made in areas where the plumbing is changing direction to assure sufficient clearance and retention.

DS-158; Ref. DS-158; 80 N (18.0 lbf) Min; 100 N (22.5 lbf) Min  7.1.1  Christmas Tree Clips  Christmas tree type fasteners must only be installed into material within their validated thickness range.  All clip mounting holes shall be punched according to standard punch sizes.  Common North America sizes are: Holes – 6.6 mm and 9.5 mm Slots – 6 mm X 9 mm, 6.2 mm X 12 mm and 7 mm X 12 mm  When metal die-draw allows, direction of hole punches for clips should be in same direction that clips will be inserted in production.  Ensure that each combination of hole size, material thickness, clip style and clip material has been evaluated by an Ergonomics Specialist for acceptable forces according to DS-158, Ergonomics Process Driven Design Standard.  Multi-tube clips should have attachment in the center of the clip.  7.1.2  Stud Mounted Clips  Recommended stud size is M6.  Multi-tube clips should have attachment in the center of the clip.  7.2  Threaded Fasteners  Case hardened tapping screws must not be used to fasten any chassis component.  Conditions present in the chassis environment could lead to fracture of a case hardened fastener.  Although tapping screws should generally be avoided, where they are utilized, they must meet the requirements of MS-8253<S>, Induction Tip Hardened - Thread Rolling - Tapping Screws. Design should incorporate an anti-rotate feature for all screw-on applications. Threaded fasteners must be chosen under the consultation of regional Fastener Engineering team. Threaded fasteners must be used when the assembly or service loads exceed the retention force of Christmas tree or stud mounted clips.   8  ASSEMBLY, SERVICE, SHIPPING AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS  8.1  Assembly and Service Considerations  Plumbing must accommodate vehicle assembly considerations as well as field service.  Clearance guidelines in Table 4 account for manufacturing variation.  Verify sufficient hand and tool access for vehicle assembly and service. North America Tools can be accessed in TeamCenter; the path is shown in Figure 9. EMEA region tools library is available at TC# FA00AAA05245/001.0001-ATTREZZI. Manufacturing Engineering (AME) has hand access models such as the one shown in Figure 10.    Figure 9  -  TC Path for North America Tools   Figure 10  -  TC Hand Access Model  Ensure all attaching clips have positive alignment features to poke yoke the assembly process. Provide anti-rotation for torqued joints. Provide error proofing to ensure only one correct assembled location, orientation. Provide adequate clearance for decking Provide adequate clearance for tooling, such as power nut runners, fill heads, etc. Ensure proper ergonomics.  Reference Ergonomics Process Driven Design Standard, DS-158, Ergonomics Process Driven Design Standard. Avoid blind connections. When using quick connects, they must be of the type that the tab closes only when fully engaged When plumbing routing is operator dependent on clip location, provide markings for clips. Ensure clip insertion and retention force requirements are met. Provide sufficient part flexibility so that end point connections can be made efficiently. Accommodate in-process stowage requirements. Sub-assembly stations must be designed so that plumbing is secured in final vehicle position.  8.2  Shipping and Handling Considerations  Plumbing must meet handling and shipping requirements of the component manufacturing plant, module assembly plant, and vehicle assembly plant.  Plumbing must be packed and shipped without bending or kinking beyond their functional and dimensional capability. Plumbing must be packaged such that clips remain attached, maintain original position and orientation, and do not get snagged during removal from shipping racks or containers. Components with open connections must be protected from damage or contamination during shipping and storage.  At the earliest opportunity, plant shipping trials are to be conducted to ensure the parts conform to the requirements of this standard.  8.3  Component Manufacturing Requirements  Plumbing must be designed to meet component manufacturing requirements such as:  Minimum length between bends Minimum distance between fittings and bends Minimum distance from end fitting to first bend  Refer to appropriate SOP, Best Practice and/or PF specification for detailed requirements.   9  APPROVED SOURCE LIST  Not applicable.    \",\n",

The following diagram presents a high-level view of the overall system architecture with the Mobile Device as the main topic of this specification:    Figure   -  BIMD Context View   The next sections provide details around the Mobile Device and associated interfaces.   2.1  General Description  The Mobile Device including the communication channels and the applications on the device are the focus for these security requirements.  The supported Mobile Device platforms include:  ; Platform; Description; Android; An open source mobile OS based on the Linux kernel primarily developed by Google.  Authorized devices utilize the Google Play Store to publish and download Android applications.  The platform is continually updated with the Google Nexus devices being the first to receive official releases.\\nAndroid Auto is a Google developed Android platform framework specifically developed to present an In-Vehicle interface on the HU to apps executing on the Mobile Device also known as projection.\\nBaidu CarLife is an application that could be projected and operated in the HU, being a software based solution it will not need any hardware to be added in the HU side. HU will support the PD with Android OS.; Apple iOS; The Apple proprietary mobile OS supported on iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Apple TV devices.  The iOS applications are published and downloaded from the Apple Store. \\nCarPlay is an Apple developed iOS platform framework specifically developed to present an In-Vehicle interface on the HU to apps executing on the Mobile Device also known as projection.\\nBaidu CarLife is an application that could be projected and operated in the HU, being a software based solution it will not need any hardware to be added in the HU side. HU will support the PD with iOS.   The mobile devices include the following groups of interfaces:  Mobile Device to SDP Interfaces Vehicle to Mobile Device Interfaces Mobile Device to Internet Interfaces  The following diagram presents the use-case interactions of various devices and systems (identified as actors) with the Mobile Device:   Figure   -  BIMD Use cases  The following table lists the actors involved in the system:  ; Actor; Description; Head Unit/TBM; The Head Unit presents information to the customer and accepts user input for controlling Uconnect features.\\nThis includes the telematics module with the cell network communication interfaces.; SDP System; The SDP is the central point for managing the Uconnect service across various vehicle platforms and thus includes several interfaces.; Mobile Device; The UAA mobile app runs on an Android or iOS Mobile Device.; Internet; Various service providers are accessed through the Internet.  Additionally, the WiFi Hot Spot / Access Point feature provides Internet access.    The following table outlines each use case associated with interfaces to SDP:  ; Use Case; Description; Mobile Device to SDP Interfaces; The UAA Mobile App includes TCP/IP communication through the cellular or WiFi connection to the SDP to execute remote operations, complete service provisioning, and vehicle data collection.; HU/TBM to Mobile Device Interfaces; These interfaces include communicate channels over USB or WiFi Direct connections between the HU and the Mobile Device.  Interfaces include infotainment, diagnostics, and projection services.  Additionally, Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto frameworks will communicate over USB and WiFi Direct interfaces between the HU and Mobile Device.; Mobile Device to Internet Interfaces; These interfaces will involve the Mobile App calling service providers over an IP network (cellular or WiFi) for accessing web based content and services.  Additionally, features such as Push Notification (Google Cloud Message / Apple Push Service) and Over the Air Update (OTA) of apps and the mobile OS are completed over this interface.   2.2  Security Benefits  Securing the interfaces to the Mobile Device and the Mobile Application internals will benefit the Customer, FCA, and the Application Provider by preparing for malicious attempts to capture Customer data and misuse Uconnect services.  The investment in an overall secure Uconnect system is to reduce the risk of a financially liable security breach and the loss of revenue due to unauthorized use of Uconnect services.  2.3  Assumptions and Dependencies  The following assumptions and dependencies apply to the security requirements and assessment of the Mobile Device:  These requirements include but are not limited to the previously identified interfaces.  The Uconnect system is continuously improving and providing new services which will result in new and modified interfaces in the future.  Periodic comprehensive security assessments will be expected which include the Mobile Device Uconnect application along with all connected networks and devices.  It is understood Mobile Devices are extremely vulnerable platforms and best efforts must be made to not allow sensitive data to be accessed by applications on the device.  It is not in the scope of these requirements to assess the security of the Mobile Device OS.  The reference architectures provided in this document (Annex A) are normative requirements with a reference implementation.  Section 3.0 include the requirements for the design to meet.  2.4  Overview of Potential Threats  The following table has been put together to help convey the breadth of Mobile Device vulnerabilities which is by no means a comprehensive list of possible threats:  ; Threat; Risks; Possible Countermeasure(s); Installing and executing the app on a jailbroken, rooted, or unlocked device; Obtaining access to keystore to render secure encryption useless.\\nExecution of illegitimate software such as key loggers or other malware to capture user credentials and sensitive information.\\nImpact the device stability.\\nAllow reverse engineering of apps and communication protocols to HU and SDP.; Add check for jailbroken, rooted, or unlocked mobile device to prevent app installation or execution.; Malicious Code Injection in app code; Obtaining access to keystore to render secure encryption useless.\\nAddition of wire taps to leak sensitive information.\\nAllow reverse engineering of apps and communication protocols to HU and SDP.; The App must be signed with an appropriate digital signature and not the default.

Google and Apple will constantly be updating their mobile OS’s with security patches to address such attacks.  Since we cannot guarantee the end user’s mobile devices are up to date and not rooted or jailbroken, we need to treat them as potentially insecure devices.  The Mobile device can be used in different ways depending on the HU platform architecture and the intended use.  The following diagram presents the three different use case scenarios in which the BIMD plays a different role in network communication:    Figure   -  BIMD Communication Use Cases  The following table summarizes each of these use cases:  ; Use Case; Description; BIMD to SDP Communication; The BIMD includes a Mobile App which can be used to connect to the backend SDP and access sensitive data and execute remote commands.  In this scenario user credentials are required to authenticate with the SDP and authorize access to data and remote operations provided by services on the SDP.; BIMD to HU Communication; The BIMD can connect to the HU to support features such as projection from the BIMD to the HU found with Android Auto and CarPlay.   Both Android Auto and CarPlay will be prime targets for hackers as these technologies will span many OEMs.  OEM extensions to these technologies will require additional layers of security to authenticate and authorize access to sensitive data and operations.; Via BIMD, HU to SDP Communication; The BIMD is required to provide network connectivity between the HU and the SDP for those HU’s with no embedded cellular device.  The ability to securely provide this feature without the user providing credentials will improve usability.  Utilizing a tunneling approach to allow encrypted network traffic between the HU and SDP to be routed through the BIMD will prevent MITM attacks which is a viable possibility with a compromised Mobile Device.   2.6  Continuous Security Process  Suppliers shall comply with Norm 9002 on software security process.

Annex A (Normative) Reference Architecture for BIMD Tunneling  The next sections provide reference architectures for each scenario described in section 2.  A-1  BIMD Security - Architecture Components  The following example reference architecture depicts utilizing a mobile device as a tunnel to route traffic on the Internet:    Figure A1  -  BIMD Security Components  Given mobile OS’s can potentially execute on hardware with compromised key stores, the reference architecture refrains from executing cryptographic functions on the mobile device.   The following table describes the elements of the reference architecture:  ; Component; Description; HU/TBM HSM; The Head Unit contains a FIPS 140-2 validated Hardware Security Module which adheres to PKCS#11 standard interfaces.  All secure communications shall utilize the HSM to encrypt and decrypt data.  \\nThe private and public keys are uniquely assigned to the specific HU/TBM following the CFTS Chapter 84 on unique ECU credentials for mutual authentication. \\nThis unique credentials are used for all communications to outside the ECU with the private key never leaving the HSM.\\nThe SDP and any other backend service public keys/certificates shall be provisioned on the HU HSM to support server authentication.; Server Side HSM; The backend server(s) contain a FIPS 140-2 validated Hardware Security Module which adheres to PKCS#11 standard interfaces.  All secure communications shall utilize the HSM to encrypt and decrypt data.  \\nThe backend server Public Key(s) will be provisioned on the HU to support client side authentication of the server.; TCP/IP Tunnel; The Mobile Device will host a tunnel service to support tunneling of secure communication channels between the HU and backend systems including the SDP.  Given the Mobile Device is a potentially hostile environment; there will be no PKI on the device to support decryption of the secure channel.; Secure End-to-End TCP/IP Channel; A TLS 1.2 TCP/IP connection established between the HU and SDP via a Tunnel on the Mobile Device shall be used for all communication of sensitive data.  \\nMutual authentication of public keys between the HU and SDP shall be conducted to establish a ‘strong’ secure connection.; Mobile Device App; This app can be part of the Radio/TBM access application and shall support the following features.\\nSubscribe to the HU to receive data on-demand or at some determined frequency.  \\nForward data to SDP on secure connection to SDP; Secure Channel between Mobile Device and SDP; A secure channel will be established between the client app and the SDP once the client has been successfully authenticated and deemed untampered.  Once established the app will be allowed access to sensitive data on an as needed basis.  The server side shall have appropriate access controls in place to revoke access at a granular level.    A-2  HU Tunneling through the BIMD - Communication Channels  Figure A2  -  Communication Channels  The following types of channels will be established :  BIMD to HU communication channel as detailed in section 0  A-3  Securing HU to SDP connection.  HU to SDP authentication channel as detailed in section 0  A-4  Securing BIMD to SDP/NGUA Backend connection.  HU – BIMD secure communication using TLS PSK in section 0  A-5  BIMD Tunneling End to End (Establishing TLS-PSK.  HU application tunnels   Two approaches are considered for achieving tunneling through BIMD.  Port forwarding approach  All IP data packets received at a local port in the BIMD are forwarded to a preconfigured remote destination The client applications (HU) are aware and responsible for setting up and tearing the port forwarding for each application     Proxy service approach  All client applications (HU) connect to the respective services on the internet while proxying through the proxy service No separate channel/port for each application Applications are not aware of establishing and tore down based on the request from client (HU)  The preferred approach is 2 (proxy based).   A-3  Securing HU to SDP connection  HU authenticates the backend using chain of trust in the ECU. It is a requirement in TBM and VP4R MY19 to have unique ECU credentials. The back office will use this unique X509 credentials for mutually authenticating with the HU.  Refer CFTS Chapter 84 for ECU security requirements Refer Unique ECU credentials document for PKI and GH requirements.   Figure A3  -  HU to SDP Authentication and getting Pre-shared Key  A-4  Securing BIMD to SDP/NGUA Backend connection  A customer’s phone can be registered as a valid BIMD for a HU with the SDP (Sprint, SXM, FCA etc). This can be done online or with the help of a call center advisor. Customer can assign himself a PIN for remote operations.  Sequence  Customer downloads application Associates BIMD with vehicle at the SDP provider/FCA Establishes login credentials and PIN Logins to the mobile Application (NGUA) NGUA backend authenticates the user and assigns a session token Retrieve the TLS-PSK key from PSK Manager    Figure A4  -  BIMD to SDP Authentication and getting PSK   A-5  BIMD Tunneling End to End (Establishing TLS-PSK Control Channel and Application Tunnel)  Uconnect radios have the capability to connect to customer’s Brought in Mobile Phone (BIMD) over a USB or WiFi connection over Carplay/Android Auto. The connection abstraction uses TCP/IP over the projection technology.  To secure this connection, the proposal is to use TLS 1.2 with dynamic Preshared keys (PSK).  Unique keys are created for a BIMD-HU pair in the backend PSK manager. These keys are refreshed periodically based on the criteria in section x. BIMD and HU fetches the recent key from the backend on a secure connection and uses for securing the local HU-BIMD connection.  Control channel listener is started on port 2225 on the BIMD and accepts one connection from HU.   Figure A5  -  BIMD Tunneling End to End   A-6  Application establishing Tunnel (Eg:360L) to SDP  Application (Eg:SXM 360L) needing BIMD connection does the following in port forwarding approach –  Registers with OE Extension Service and gets notified of available connections.  App chooses embedded vs BIMD connection depending on its preference  If BIMD is chosen, App calls ‘establish Remote connection’ API with the following parameters to the listening service on control channel  Host with SXM 360L URL including port Priority (optional) Return Values BIMD local port and Connection id  Application (360L) connects to BIMD local IP: local port and the data is tunneled to the SXM URL by the BIMD.  In proxy approach step 3 is not needed and application connects to SXM URL specifying proxy URL.  A-7  Error Scenarios  Customer BIMD does not have Uconnect Access App Customer BIMD has Uconnect Access App, but not able to authenticate with the backend  A-8  BIMD Application Assumptions  Uconnect Access App can receive a ‘start application command’ through a Car Play/Android event notification triggered by the HU without requiring the user to login and start the application manually.  Uconnect application on Android and iPhone can run the Access Application in the background even when the phone is locked (this is required for the tunneling to run)  User should have logged into the Access application at least once and shall have valid authentication token for a secure connection to be established between HU and BIMD.  If BIMD authentication fails for any reason, user will be prompted to login and start the application and login manually.  Negotiation of which phone gets connected to the radio is managed by the Android Auto/CarPlay protocols.   A-9  IP and Ports Reserved  BIMD will be assigned the local IP 192.168.2.65 BIMD Listening/receiving ports  2224 – Authentication tunnel to FCA PSK Manager (tentative URL – https://authservice.fca.com) 2225 – Control channel listener 3333- 3399 – Reserved for application tunnels (in the port forward approach).

The tailor welded blanks manufactured by this process shall be suitable for subsequent stamping (forming) operations.  1.2  Coverage of this Standard (Applicability and Limitations on Usage)  Regions covered by this standard: North America, Western Europe, Central Europe, Southern Europe, South America, China, and India.  The application of this standard is restricted to weldable sheet steel grades as defined in MS.50001 and MS.50002, coated and uncoated. Laser welding of steels with carbon equivalent higher than 0.30% shall be on an application-specific basis after approval by the Regional Stellantis Materials or Manufacturing Welding Engineering Groups and appropriate process validation testing.  The carbon equivalent (C.E.) is calculated by the following formula:  C.E. = %C + %Mn/6 + %Ni/20 + %Cr/10 + %Cu/40 - %Mo/50 - %V/10  The application of this standard is generally restricted to sheet steels with thicknesses less than or equal to 3.0 mm and thickness ratios less than or equal to 2.  Sheet thickness or thickness ratios exceeding these limits shall be approved by Stellantis Materials or Manufacturing Engineering Welding Engineering Groups prior to specification. Tailor welded blank suppliers should be consulted for determination of welding feasibility. Stamping simulations should be performed to determine feasibility in the intended application.  To minimize out-gassing during welding and its resulting porosity, only killed steels shall be used.  Control of weld chemistry, solidification rate (including the resulting microstructure) and formability can be more challenging when welding PHS, PQS, and GEN3 steels such as TB and TR. Refer to the applicable MS.50001 or MS.50002 standard for steel grade-specific laser welding requirements or restrictions.  Laser welding of butt welds with requisite quality depends upon the specific combination of materials and material coatings intended for joining. All intended applications of steels with ultimate tensile strength greater than or equal to 780 MPa shall be reviewed in detail with the current author of PS.50005/05 to determine an appropriate course of evaluation prior to any engineering release of laser welding.\\xa0Refer to the applicable Table C-1 or C-2 in Annex C for minimum evaluation requirements.  1.3  Requirements on Part Drawings  The length, number, and location of the weld(s) shall be as specified on the drawing. Any weld requirements designated on the detailed assembly engineering releases supersede the requirements specified within this standard.  The tailor welded blank edges and the weld start/stop shall be designed and produced such that the final component shall have the weld start/stop and blank edges removed (trimmed off) after welding or after stamping.  This is critical for PHS and PQS steels as they are often subject to cracking in the weld start/stop locations. This may also apply to cold stamping steels with ultimate tensile strength greater than or equal to 780 MPa. 1.3.1  Welding Symbols  The symbol shown in Figure 1 shall be used together with a reference to this process standard in the title block.

Edge quality (straightness, burr, edge roll, break angle, shear angle) shall not interfere with sheet alignment and welding.     4.1.1  Aluminum Silicon Coated Steels for PHS or PQS Applications  When employing steels coated with aluminum silicon alloy (AlSi), such as MS.50001 PHS or PQS the welding process needs to address the aluminum concentration and distribution in the weld pool as the aluminum can suppress the martensite transformation. To that end there are several approved methods available for welding press hardened steel (PHS) and/or press quenched steel (PQS) depending upon material grade combinations that are to be welded.  If one of these methods is in use and it is desired to change to another method, Stellantis shall be informed and data shall be provided showing that the change has not affected the performance of the weld in the press hardened state. Refer to Annex C, Table C-2 for minimum evaluation requirements.  In addition to Table C-2 requirements, the appropriate Forever Requirement (FR), Change Notice (CN), and Production Evaluation Run (PER) will be required.  ; Table 3  -  AlSi Coated PQS and PHS Steel \\nApproved Material Combinations and Process Options\\n(Refer to process descriptions in Sections 4.1.1.1 through 4.1.1.3); Table 3  -  AlSi Coated PQS and PHS Steel \\nApproved Material Combinations and Process Options\\n(Refer to process descriptions in Sections 4.1.1.1 through 4.1.1.3); Approved Material Combinations; Approved Processes; PHS to PQS; Option 1: Two-Sided Ablation; PHS to PQS; Option 2: Single-Sided Ablation with Approved Filler Metal; PHS to PQS; Option 3: Ablation-Free with Approved Filler Metal; PHS to PHS; Option 1: Two-Sided Ablation; PHS to PHS; Option 3: Ablation-Free with Approved Filler Metal  4.1.1.1  Option 1 - Two-Sided Ablation  To avoid weld pool contamination by the material coating, the aluminum silicon alloy coating is removed by laser ablation (either full or partial removal) with possible mechanical removal before laser welding. The coating shall be removed 1.20 mm ± 0.5 mm from the edges to be joined on both sides of all sheets.  To accommodate gaps, it is acceptable to add a filler metal consisting of manganese boron steel with additional alloying element(s) to produce a weld with the required strength and ductility in the press hardened condition.  4.1.1.2  Option 2 - Single-Sided Ablation with Approved Filler Metal  To avoid weld pool contamination by the material coating, the aluminum silicon alloy coating is removed from only one side (the laser beam weld side) by laser ablation (either full or partial removal). In this method, the addition of filler metal is required. The filler metal shall consist of manganese boron steel alloyed with additional alloying element(s) to produce a weld with the required strength and ductility in the press hardened condition and allow the aluminum content to be less than 1.3%.  4.1.1.3  Option 3 - Ablation-Free with Approved Filler Metal  The aluminum silicon alloy coating is not removed prior to welding. In this method, to produce a weld with the required strength and ductility in the press hardened condition, the reduction of the amount of aluminum as well as mitigation of the metallurgical effects of aluminum in the weldment are required. This is accomplished by the introduction of an appropriate filler metal that shall contain austenite stabilizing elements of a sufficient amount to dilute the aluminum content to less than 10%. The use of hot-wire laser welding (heated filler wire) is preferable as this technique is beneficial in narrow gap welding and produces lower distortion and residual stress.  4.1.2  Shielding Gas  An inert gas, such as argon or helium, shall be used to protect the molten weld pool metal during laser beam welding.  Gas-free welding or use of other gases or gas mixtures may only be used with written approval by Stellantis Materials or Manufacturing Engineering - Welding Engineering after providing evidence that the proposed gas situation is not detrimental to the welding process or the resulting requirement for use.  4.1.3  Filler Metal  Filler metal in the form of rod or wire is not ordinarily used in laser butt welding of cold stamped sheet steel blanks.  If a filler metal is required, it shall be specified on the engineering releases. Refer to section 4.1.1 for PQS and PHS steel applications that require filler metal. 4.1.4  Part Fit-up  To ensure proper fit-up, all parts shall be accurately located and clamped.  4.1.4.1  Gap  The gap tolerance of the butt joint is dependent on material thickness, weld speed, beam diameter and quality. Normally, gap tolerance increases with material thickness.  Ideally the mating parts shall be in contact at the weld area.  Gap will affect filler metal dilution. When using filler metal in PHS and PQS applications, the maximum allowable gap that produces acceptable weld mechanical properties in the thermally transformed condition shall be determined. Maximum allowable gap shall be considered in the development of production process control plans.  4.2  Procedure  Not applicable.  4.3  Process Control  4.3.1  Process Potential Study  At initial production start-up of the process, the supplier, in conjunction with the Stellantis Quality Responsible Group, shall perform a Process Potential Study. If PQS or PHS steels are to be used in tailor welded blanks, the Process Potential Study shall include weld performance in the press hardened condition.  Refer to Stellantis Quality Systems Requirements, PRO.00109, and IAFT16949 Quality Management System.  4.3.2  Process Capability Study  Following successful completion of the Process Potential Study, the supplier shall perform a Process Capability Study. If PQS or PHS steels are to be used in tailor welded blanks, the process capability study shall include weld performance, assessed in the press hardened condition.  Refer to Stellantis Quality Systems Requirements, PRO.00109, and IATF 16949 Quality Management System.  4.4  Inspection Requirements  The primary objective of the following inspection procedures is to ensure that adequate process control is being employed and to define the quality level required for laser welded sheet steel blanks. 4.4.1  Visual Inspection <S>  Many discrepant welds can be detected visually.  Welds can be discrepant because of either a lack of quantity or quality in the weld.  The discontinuity limits shown in Table 5 shall be applied individually.  Exceeding any of the maximum discontinuity limits or failure to meet any of the minimum weld dimensional characteristic requirements is cause for rejection of the welded blank.  The surfaces shall not contain burrs.  4.4.2  Metallographic Inspection  In the event that any of the weld requirements listed in section 4.4.3 and 4.4.4 cannot be positively established by the procedures noted, or for arbitration of a disagreement, the final decision shall be based on a micro-examination of a metallographic section. 4.4.3  Weld Cross-Section Dimensional Characteristics  Weld cross-section dimensional characteristic requirements are shown in Table 4. Under severe draw conditions or to ensure tensile test fractures outside of the weld fusion zone, higher DMIN limits may have to be established.  The applicable design and manufacturing areas shall be responsible for determining when higher DMIN limits are necessary.  If DMIN or lower DMAX limits are required that deviate from this standard, they shall be specified on the engineering release.  ; Table 4  -  Weld Cross-Section Dimensional Requirements Prior to Stamping; Table 4  -  Weld Cross-Section Dimensional Requirements Prior to Stamping; Dimensional Characteristic; Requirements; 4.1 Mismatch (Y,Z); “t” is the thinner material thickness\\nNegative mismatch “Y” applies to equal and unequal thickness combinations.\\nPositive mismatch “Z” applies to offsets with the thinner material aligned within the thickness of the thicker material.; 4.2 DMIN and DMAX; “t” is the thinner material thickness\\n“T” is the thicker material thickness\\nDMIN is the minimum dimension from the weld root (bottom surface) to the weld face (top surface), perpendicular to the sheet surface\\nDMAX is the maximum dimension from the weld root (bottom surface) to the weld face (top surface), perpendicular to the sheet surface  4.4.4  Weld Discontinuity Limits  Weld discontinuity limits are shown in Table 5. If discontinuity limits are required that deviate from this standard, they shall be specified on the engineering releases.  ; Table 5  -  Weld Discontinuity Limits; Table 5  -  Weld Discontinuity Limits; Dimensional Characteristic; Limit; 5.1 Cracks <S>; Cracks in the weld metal, heat affected zone, or base metal are not permitted.; 5.2 Undercut; Undercut shall not exceed 0.1t, where “t” is the thinner material thickness.; 5.3 Incomplete Fusion; The full thickness of both sheets shall be fused. Incomplete fusion is not permitted.; 5.4 Porosity; Porosity shall not exceed 25 percent of the surface area of the weld.  Welds shall not contain any holes or pores that extend through the thickness when examined using non-destructive evaluation techniques.; 5.5 Burn-Through; Burn-through is not permitted.  4.4.5  Laboratory Tests  4.4.5.1  Tensile Tests  The laser weld shall have higher strength than the base metal.  This shall be evaluated by performing tensile tests of samples which contain the laser weld perpendicular to the direction of the applied load.  The test shall be conducted per ASTM E8.  The sample shall fracture outside of the fusion zone.  4.4.5.2  Cupping Tests  In any cupping test, e.g. Olsen Cup, Erichsen or Limiting Dome Height, the test sample shall not fracture through or along the weld seam within the fusion zone.  The sample must be obtained from the tailor welded blank and must have a width > 90 mm and a length that permits the execution of at least 4 bulges (domes). The weld seam shall be on the test sample centerline. The test equipment can be used for steel sheets with thickness between 0.6 mm to 3.0 mm, inclusive.  The test shall be executed being careful to position the welding seam on the punch center axis.  In the case of unequal thickness sheets, it is necessary to compensate for the thickness difference between the two sheets by inserting, near the blank holder, a steel sheet with a thickness equal to the measured difference. The cupping test shall be carried out in two orientations: weld seam root up and weld seam root down. See ANNEX A for examples of acceptable and unacceptable fractures.  4.4.6  Other Tests  Upon request and with agreement between the parties involved, additional tests not provided by this standard may be specified.  When PQS and PHS steels are used, the weld shall meet performance requirements in the press hardened condition as assessed by but not limited to: hardness, microstructure, tensile strength, yield strength, and elongation.  4.5  Re-process  Not permitted.   5  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  In applications where PHS steel is welded to higher ductility, lower strength PQS steel, the weld chemistry and the press hardening process window (temperature, time, and cooling rate) shall produce a weld such that the hardness is intermediate between that of the PHS and the PQS steel.  In applications where PHS steel is welded to PHS steel, the weld performance in the press hardened condition shall be indistinguishable from the base material performance.  In the thermally transformed condition, tensile test fractures shall generally occur outside of the weld metal (fusion zone). For certain PQS to PHS and PHS to PHS material thickness and grade combinations, fractures in the weld metal may be approved by Stellantis Materials or Manufacturing Engineering – Welding Engineering. Stellantis Materials or Manufacturing Engineering – Welding Engineering consideration for approval of weld metal fractures shall be based on the material strength and thickness ratios and generally requires that the following four conditions are met.  Weld tensile strength shall exceed the minimum tensile strength of the lower strength material. Weld tensile strength (MPa) is determined as the peak load (N) divided by the cross-sectional area at the weld joint (mm2). Cross-sectional area is approximated as DMIN (mm) (determined from a representative untested metallographic sample, refer to Table 4, 4.2) multiplied by the tensile test sample width (mm). Fracture shall be ductile. Ductile fracture can be determined by SEM images exhibiting microvoid coalescence (dimple) fracture surface, or a metallographic cross-section exhibiting necking and fracture in an angular plane through the thickness, not following the fusion boundary. The majority of the test samples within the replicate group shall fracture outside of the fusion zone. Elongation of the sample that fractured in the weld fusion zone shall be similar to those within the replicate group that fractured outside of the weld fusion zone.   6  QUALITY  The supplier's quality plan shall meet the requirements specified in the quotation package and described in Stellantis Quality Systems Requirements, and IATF 16949 Quality Management System. The supplier's system plan shall assure initial production shipments and those made subsequently through the year meet Stellantis requirements.  Volume production must conform to Stellantis specifications and meet or exceed quality and performance levels of the most recent samples approved by Stellantis.   7  TEST EQUIPMENT  Not applicable.  7.1  Test Facilities  Not applicable.  7.2  Test Equipment  Not applicable.   8  SAFETY PRECAUTIONS  Class IV lasers are involved in laser welding operations and as such they have their own safety precautions. It is recommended that the American National Standard for Safe Use of Lasers ANSI Z136.1 be consulted for safe operating standards.  Welding materials and the welding process may contain and release toxic elements.  The user shall comply with all applicable corporate and government fume ventilation requirements when welding.  Certain important information relative to this standard has been included in separate standards.  To assure the processes meet Stellantis requirements, it is mandatory that the requirements in the following standards be met.

End of Annex B   Annex C (NORMATIVE) Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements for New High Strength or Hot Stamped Steel Grades and New Welding or Stamping Processes  In order to evaluate new high strength steel grades for compatibility with the tailor blank process or to evaluate new tailor blank welding or stamping processes with existing steel grades prior to release in product applications, the minimum weld seam evaluation requirements in Tables C-1 and C-2 shall be performed. These initial evaluations are in addition to any standard Stellantis Quality Systems Requirements, as required by the Stellantis Quality Responsible Group and are not necessarily intended for ongoing conformance testing during serial production. In addition to the weld-specific requirements for hot stamped steel, additional testing may be required to ensure minimum base metal mechanical properties are achieved outside of the weld zone.  ; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Table C-1  -  Minimum Weld Seam Evaluation Requirements\\nCold Stampings Containing at Least One Steel Grade with Tensile Strength ≥ 780 MPa; Condition Being Evaluated; Test Panel Quantity; Cupping Test\\nPer Test Panel; Weld \\nTensile Tests\\nPer Test Panel\\n(NOTE 2); Weld \\nCross-Section Metallographic Inspections\\nPer Test Panel\\n(NOTE 3); Weld \\nCross-Section Microhardness Traverses\\nPer Test Panel\\n(NOTE 4); Cold stamping \\n(New steel grade); NOTE 1; All weld seams containing the new steel grade \\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams containing the new steel grade \\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams containing the new steel grade \\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams containing the new steel grade \\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); Cold stamping\\n(New welding \\nprocess); NOTE 1; All weld seams\\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams\\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams\\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); All weld seams\\n(One of each test/inspection per weld seam); NOTE 1: Stampings or flat test panels representing all intended material thickness and grade combinations can be used for evaluations.

Whenever an STLA rubber material specification is included on the drawing of a rubber part, it is mandatory for the supplier to gain approval of their compound to that specification.  If the rubber manufacturer is not Tier 1 to STLA, the Tier 1 supplier shall take the responsibility to gain approval of their sub-suppliers' material to the required specification.  Unless otherwise directed, the supply base shall assume that all rubber hoses/hose materials and rubber materials used in powertrain components that seal either internal or external leak paths shall be approved to the appropriate material specification.  Rubber materials used for other components shall be reviewed with the appropriate STLA rubber materials engineer prior to starting the approval process.  6.2  Source/ Material Approval Requirements  This section covers the requirements for approval of rubber materials to STLA Rubber Material Specifications.  All testing for final specification development/material approval must be based on materials processed using the production intent mixing process.  Laboratory batch mixing for material approval is not allowed.  The candidate rubber supplier shall submit the complete data package as described in the Material Approval section in this document.  Upon approval, rubber materials shall be considered products globally available to STLA.  Approval by region shall be granted for unique applications only upon request.  6.3  Physical Property Testing  Test samples shall be molded / fabricated in a manner to obtain a state of cure that shall be representative of production parts.  When it is required to obtain samples directly from finished parts, material evaluations shall be performed on test specimens obtained in accordance with ISO 23529 / ASTM D3183.  See the material specification for other details.  The general procedures for preparing and conditioning test samples for physical property characteristic testing are listed in ISO 23529/ISO 2393 or ASTM D3182/ASTM D3183.  Stellantis reserves the right to request any portion of the material evaluations for approval to be done by an ISO/IEC 17025 certified independent laboratory.  If required, expenses incurred shall be the responsibility of the first tier and/or sub-tier suppliers. Stellantis also reserves the right to perform rubber material testing at internal laboratories in order to generate comparative data.

Use of a supplier and material listed on an EASL does not guarantee success for all applications.  Each application must undergo proper design/ performance verification testing as directed by the program release engineer.  7.2  Use of Current STLA Direct Supplier Not Listed on Applicable EASL  Current STLA rubber part suppliers not listed on the applicable EASL can be utilized as sub-tier level suppliers, but must be evaluated against and added to the applicable material standard.  7.3  Use of non-STLA Direct Suppliers  Elastomer part fabricators that are not in the STLA supply base can be utilized providing the following steps are followed:  - Fabricator must meet all requirements, as outlined in this standard. - The first tier or sub-tier supplier directly downstream of the rubber part fabricator must demonstrate to the responsible STLA materials engineer the availability of in-house technical expertise to initially review and periodically monitor the rubber part fabricators’ processes and procedures, or contract for these services from an independent consultant.  Independent consultant information, such as references and background, must be supplied to STLA prior to involvement in audits. - Manufacturing Audit Checklist is to be used as an audit tool.  Auditors may add additional items to this checklist.  This checklist shall be available upon request and is be used to generate a full audit report, which shall be submitted to STLA Materials Engineering.  Upon successful material and part performance validation testing, the STLA first tier supplier shall be referenced on the ASL as the approved source with the actual fabricator listed in parenthesis.  7.4  Other Requirements  In all cases, the first tier supplier is directly responsible for the design, quality, function, and durability of the elastomeric part.  This responsibility includes coordination of typical design verification tools and techniques such as (this list may not include all tools and techniques):  - Stack studies, based on the mating component tolerances. - Finite Element Analysis to insure robustness of the system in which the elastomeric part must function, at Least Material Condition and Most Material Condition. - Design Verification (DV) tests to validate proper long term function.  DV tests shall follow the design verification plan developed by the supplier, program release engineer, and the applicable component team.   8  DRAWING INFORMATION  Any additional information that is to be indicated on the drawing shall be defined as required in the relevant material specification.   9  QUALITY  The supplied parts shall be free from visible defects such as lack of material, cracks, blowholes, bubbles, folds, cuts, etc.  Parts shall be delivered with the level of requested cleanliness.  Supplied parts assembled on a component shall remain in place during transportation and assembly.   10  ADDITIONAL CONTACTS  ; Application; West Europe; South Europe; North America; Gasket - Battery; Latifa Normand\\nlatifa.normand@stellantis.com; Graziano Brocani / Silvia Ponti\\ngraziano.brocani@crf.it\\nsilvia.ponti@crf.it; Sharon Jin\\nsharon.jin@stellantis.com; Gasket - Brake; Martine Klinguer\\nmartine.klinguer@stellantis.com; Paolo Chiappero\\npaolo.chiappero@crf.it; John Kohler\\njohn.kohler@stellantis.com; Gasket - Coolant; Marine Vichot\\nmarine.vichot@stellantis.com; Paolo Chiappero; Sharon Jin; Gasket - Fuel; Angélique Caillaud\\nangelique.caillaud@stellantis.com; Paolo Chiappero; John Kohler; Gasket -Air; Martine Klinguer; Paolo Chiappero; Sharon Jin; Gasket- A/C; Christian Eude\\nchristian.eude@stellantis.com; Francesca Dalmasso\\nfrancesca.dalmasso@crf.it; John Kohler; Gasket -Oil; Latifa Normand; Paolo Chiappero; Sharon JIN / John Kohler; Hose - Brake; Martine Klinguer; Luca Rovej\\nluca.rovej@crf.it; John Kohler; Hose - Coolant; Marine Vichot; Luca Rovej; Sharon Jin; Hose - Fuel; Angélique Caillaud; Luca Rovej; John Kohler; Hose -Air; Martine Klinguer; Luca Rovej; Sharon Jin; Hose - A/C; Christian Eude; Francesca Dalmasso; John Kohler; Hose - Oil; Latifa Normand; Silvia Ponti; Sharon Jin; Belt; Latifa Normand; Paolo Chiappero; Sharon Jin; AVT - Chassis; Latifa Normand; Paolo Paolo Chiappero; John Kohler; AVT - Powertrain; Dominique Pierrat\\ndominique.Pierrat@stellantis.com; Paolo Chiappero; John Kohler; Body Sealing; Laurent Mathou\\nlaurent.mathou@stellantis.com; Graziano Brocani/Silva PontI; Ruohua Xiong\\nruohua.xiong@stellantis.com; Rubber Coated Metal Gasket; Latifa Normand; Lucia Lops\\nlucia.lops@crf.it; John Kohler; Powertrain RTV Sealing; Latifa Normand; Ignazio Andrea Alfeo\\nignazioandrea.alfeo@crf.it; John Kohler; Wiping; Christian Eude; Graziano Brocani; Ruohua Xiong    11  RELEASE AND REVISIONS  ; Change Level; Date; Description of Change; -; 13-MAR-2023; Initial release.

The heat treatment process is performed to improve mechanical properties and achieve the desired microstructure.  1.2  Coverage of this Standard (Applicability)  The quench/temper and austempering processes consist of heating parts to an elevated austenitizing temperature in a furnace either in a protective atmosphere, in a neutral salt bath environment, or in open air.  The parts are then quenched & tempered or austempered to produce the specified mechanical properties and metallurgical structure.  This standard covers parts designed/specified/purchased/released as FCA Group parts and Engineering Heat Treat Process Standard for quench and tempering as called out on the Engineering Drawing/CATIA/NX Model or referenced as a requirement in other FCA Group Material or Process Standards.  The steel grades currently used for quench and tempered or austempering applications are listed in Annex A (Carbon Steels – FCA US), Annex B (Alloy Steels – FCA US) and Annex C (FCA Italy Steels).  1.3  Limitations on Usage  This standard does not cover or include ODD Box/Black Box parts or any other industry standard parts designed and released or specified by PS-7000 ODD Box or Black Box suppliers for the FCA US using non FCA US, tier one internal, and/or foreign or generic industry heat treat standards.  This standard is a generic process standard.  It is not possible nor is it intended to cover every heat treat concern or possibility for each and every part.  Individual part and heat treat standards/specifications and requirements are detailed or listed on the FCA Group Engineering Drawing/CATIA/NX Model for each individual component.  This information must be provided to the heat treat source by the part manufacturer/tier one supplier.  Those specific part requirements and control plans developed by the heat treat source could provide more details than what is covered in this standard.

In the event of the qualification of a new heat treat supplier or a comprehensive system/process audit, the guidelines and requirements of the latest edition of the AIAG CQI-9 Heat Treat System Assessment shall be used.    5.1  Condition of the part prior to processing  The part loading procedure/loading rate shall be specified and monitored including both austenitizing and tempering.  The parts must be loaded with a set procedure per the control plan/work order or procedure to ensure all parts are properly heated during the austenitizing process and can be properly quenched.  Parts shall be positioned during loading to minimize distortion and non-uniformity of hardness.  Unique fixtures may be required to accommodate specific process requirements.  The loading procedure, loading rate and weight of the parts shall not exceed the rated or actual heating capacity of the designated furnace.  Weigh scales used shall be calibrated quarterly at a minimum.  In continuous furnace processes, adequate time and spacing must be employed per the control plan/work procedures to maintain lot identity, prevent mixed parts, and allow for process changes for lots requiring different austenitizing, quenching, or tempering temperatures and times.  All parts and fixtures shall be free of surface contaminants (such as oils or other residue) prior to entering atmosphere furnaces.  This requires incoming parts and possibly fixtures to be cleaned/washed, if possible, to remove soluble oil, cutting oils, die lubricants and other foreign material prior to heat treatment and after quenching prior to tempering.  If chemical cleaners are used, two (2) stage washers are preferred for pre-washing with the cleaner in one stage and a second stage rinse with drying.  Parts shall be washed, rinsed and dried to prevent oils, alkali salts and water from entering the atmosphere furnace.  Washing shall be noted on the control plan and work order process sheets.  Temperatures and cleaner concentrations shall be checked and recorded per the chemical manufacturer/supplier recommendation or a minimum of daily.  This pre-wash requirement does not apply to small spring clips and similar small parts that normally cannot be washed and/or are austempered.  5.2  Procedure  5.2.1  Austentizing Furnace Temperature, Time and Atmosphere  All parts shall be austenitized at a temperature of at least 28C (50F) above the upper critical temperature (Ac3) of the base material prior to quenching, unless otherwise specified.  Parts shall be held at the austenitizing temperature for a time sufficient to ensure that the parts are completely austenitized and, when quenched, attain the specified hardness range and microstructure.  The temperature in the last zone of the furnace or in the last part of the austenitizing heating cycle shall be maintained within +/-9C (+/- 15F) of the furnace set point and be recorded by continuous strip chart recorders or data loggers.  For maximum atmosphere and heating uniformity, forced atmosphere circulation within the furnace is required.  When decarburization of the surface is important, parts shall be processed with a protective atmosphere neutral to the actual/nominal carbon content of the base material/steel grade.  For neutral hardening, the carbon controller shall maintain the nominal furnace carbon potential within the carbon range of the base material being heat treated.  The austenitizing heat treatment codes in Table 5 do not necessarily list a protective atmosphere, but a protective atmosphere is typically required for most parts.  Alternatively, the use of a neutral salt bath is permitted for austenitizing, if properly controlled and rectified to maintain neutrality to the base carbon content of the material.  In the event that an inert atmosphere is used (e.g. nitrogen) in combination with a carbonaceous gas (e.g. propane), the flow rate of the carbonaceous gas shall be maintained at a level that will getter the oxygen that could be present but not at a level that would introduce carbon into the surface of the part.  When applicable, decarburization shall be defined, measured and/or rated according to ASTM E-1077.  When a protective atmosphere is required, parts shall be processed in a protective atmosphere consisting of a combination of a base endothermic carrier gas prepared from a high purity hydrocarbon gas or a diluted vaporized hydrocarbon liquid, and additions of an enriching high purity hydrocarbon gas.  Endothermic gas generators must be operated at the proper temperature, typically1010 C (1850 F) or higher.  Using an undiluted hydrocarbon gas/vaporized liquid as a base protective atmosphere is not permitted.  Heat treatment shall not be performed in atmospheres containing any ammonia.  Furnace and generator atmospheres shall be controlled by a primary control device with a continuous automated feedback loop atmosphere control system for carbon potential.  The only exception to this requirement for automatic continuous feedback loop atmosphere controllers on furnace equipment heat treating FCA Group parts is for washers, nuts, and non PF-SAFETY<S> small stampings.  A suitable backup correlation check method for carbon potential shall be used at least daily for the continuous primary control device.  A primary control device could include an oxygen probe, on-line continuous infrared system, etc.  Continuous automated atmosphere control results are to be strip charted or computer data logged.  A backup atmosphere checking device may be a manual portable dew point instrument, gas analyzer, carbon potential strip, carbon bar or shim stock, etc.  A dew pointer or any other device used to determine dew point/carbon potential as a backup checking method for oxygen probes or other continuous on-line atmosphere control systems shall be used at least once a day on each generator and furnace.  All instruments shall be used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer.  Carbon potential strips, shim stock, carbon bars or their equivalent are the recommended referee checking methods for determining actual carbon potential to verify the accuracy of other methods of carbon potential monitoring and control.  Results shall be recorded.  Proper ASM Handbook and/or manufacturer recommended methods shall be used.  An automated carbon potential alarm warning system tied into the atmosphere controller shall be installed on continuous belt furnaces used for heat treating externally threaded fasteners (exceptions shall be approved by the FCA Group Materials Engineering).  Externally threaded fastener and/or washer heat treat suppliers shall have on site for daily use a gas analyzer as a back-up to verify each generator and furnace atmosphere.  Zero and span gas correlation checks to a certified span gas for gas analysis accuracy are recommended daily and shall be performed and recorded weekly at a minimum.  Infrared Temperature Pyrometers are required at the exit end of continuous belt furnaces running threaded fasteners to monitor for under temperature parts.  The temperature alarm shall be set above the upper critical temperature (Ac3) of each steel grade and should be within 28C (50F) of the furnace exit end temperature.  It is recommended that results be strip charted or continuously data logged.  5.2.2  Quenching, Quench Oil, Synthetic Quenchants, and Salt Bath Media  All parts shall be quenched as soon as possible to obtain proper transformation.  Delayed quenching, which results in the formation of decomposition products of austenite, are detrimental to part performance and is specifically prohibited.  All parts shall be at a temperature of at least 28C (50F) above the upper critical temperature (Ac3) of the base material immediately prior to quenching unless otherwise specified.  Quenching oil shall be checked a minimum of every three months for water content, quench severity and cooling curve, viscosity, sediment, flash point and other physical characteristics deemed necessary by the oil supplier.  Data shall be recorded.  Where oil is specified as a quench medium, a water soluble polymer or synthetic quenchant shall be used as an option.  Concentration, temperature and agitation of this solution shall be controlled to obtain the desired quench severity.  Synthetic quenchants shall be checked periodically per the recommendations of the manufacturer and the data recorded.  Additions shall be recorded.  Periodic synthetic quenchant checks at a minimum shall include concentration, temperature, sediment, and viscosity and shall be done semiannually at a minimum unless the manufacturer recommends a more frequent interval.  Synthetic quenchants cannot be directly exposed to a protective furnace atmosphere.  Marquenching using molten salt is a satisfactory quench under special conditions and is permitted as an alternate to oil to minimize part distortion or to obtain unique metallurgical properties.  Salt bath analysis, activation or rectification shall be performed according to the salt manufacturers’ recommendations.  Additions shall be recorded.  Test results shall be documented and assure conformance to heat treat specification requirements.  When hot oil quenching or marquenching using molten salt is specified, the specific quenching details shall be included on the CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing/Data Sheet of the part.  Where the quench medium is specified as “water or solution,” the latter has reference to brine or caustic solutions.  Concentration, temperature and agitation shall be maintained to obtain the desired quench severity.  Concentration or specific gravity shall be checked daily.  Suspended solids shall be checked semiannually.  These quenchants cannot be directly exposed to a protective furnace atmosphere.  Quench bath temperatures shall be maintained within specified limits recommended by the manufacturer/supplier or that required in the control plan (if tighter).  Heaters and coolers are required.  Quench bath temperatures shall be recorded.  Quench systems shall be provided with sufficient forced agitation to assure a quench severity and uniformity to meet the metallurgical requirements of the surface and core.  This shall be documented in a procedure.  Quench cracks are not allowed in parts.  Any parts containing quench cracks shall be scrapped.  A root cause analysis shall be performed for any part that is quench cracked.  Furnaces having loads not automatically quenched shall have a timer and warning system to let the operator know it is time to quench the load.  Furnaces having an integral quench system shall have a signal or alarm to let the operator know that a tray has hung up or been delayed between the furnace and the quench.  Quench oil or salt shall be washed off the parts prior to tempering.  5.2.3  Tempering Furnace - Time and Temperature  All parts shall be tempered as soon as possible.  The maximum allowable end of quench to beginning of temper time delay is per the heat treat control plan or, if not specified, a maximum of one (1) hour.  After quenching, all parts shall be tempered in a re-circulating air-type furnace or in a liquid bath for sufficient time at the tempering temperature to meet the requirements of the CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing.  Tempering time or duration, which includes both total furnace time and the actual part time including the core at actual furnace temperature, shall be specified on the work order or control plan.  The temperature in the last zone of the furnace or in the last part of the tempering cycle shall be maintained within +/- 9C (+/- 15F) of the furnace set point and be recorded by continuous strip chart recorders or data loggers.  Induction or selective “snap tempering”, or stress relief as shown in the tempering operations code, if and when allowed, shall be specified for the part on the Engineering Drawing/CATIA/NX Model and shall be performed in accordance with the requirements of the process standard that covers induction hardening.  5.3  Process control  5.3.1  Lot Control and Identification  All parts shall be separated into lots so they are traceable to the original source and the steel mill heat number.  In-process work order control sheets or automated order tracking shall accompany the parts through all plant processing and properly reflect the operations performed.  Shop travelers and working documents/routers shall reference the appropriate FCA Group material/heat treat specification(s).  5.3.2  Furnace Instrumentation, Controllers, Temperature Recorders, Thermocouples and Calibration  All serviced heat treat instruments and equipment shall have a sticker attached indicating the last service date and the next calibration due date.  Sight glass ports shall be clean.  Austenitizing and tempering furnace temperatures and generator temperatures shall be continuously strip charted or continuously data logged.  A contingency plan shall be in place to ensure the data is collected in case of equipment malfunction.  Furnace instrumentation including controllers and recorders shall be calibrated/checked at least every three months by outside certified instrument service personnel from companies accredited under the calibration standards of ISO 17025 or internally by qualified instrument service personnel who are in compliance with ISO 17025 guidelines and who meet the qualifications and intent of the ISO 17025 standard.  Records shall be kept of training and qualifications of internal personnel.  Furnace instrumentation shall be checked and/or calibrated to the manufacturer’s recommendations for the particular instrument and shall meet the original manufacturer’s accuracy standards.  Service control thermocouples shall be checked or replaced monthly for furnaces operating at or above 760C (1400F) and quarterly for furnaces operating below 760C (1400F) by outside certified instrument service personnel from companies accredited under the calibration standards of ISO 17025 or internally by qualified service personnel who are in compliance with ISO 17025 guidelines and who meet the qualifications and intent of the ISO 17025 standard.  In all cases, type K/N thermocouples shall be replaced annually if used at high temperatures and every two (2) years (bi-annually) if used at low temperatures.  In all cases, type R/S thermocouples shall be replaced every two (2) years (bi-annually).  Records shall be kept of training and qualifications of internal personnel.  Test thermocouples and verification instruments shall be certified and traceable to NIST.  When thermocouples are checked, thermocouple protection tubes shall also be checked and replaced if necessary.  The maximum allowable range for service control thermocouple checks is +/- 6C (+/- 10F), otherwise corrective action is required.  All newly installed service control thermocouples shall be verified and checked in-place prior to use.  Records shall be kept.  Service control thermocouples shall be separate from over temperature thermocouples.  Infrared Temperature Pyrometers are required at the exit end of continuous belt furnaces running externally threaded fasteners to monitor for under temperature parts.  The temperature alarm shall be set above the upper critical temperature (Ac3) of each steel grade and shall be within 28C (50F) of the furnace exit end temperature actually used.  Results should be strip charted or continuously data logged.  IR units shall be calibrated annually to a black body standard at a minimum.  Periodic instrument verifications shall be performed according to a schedule, if possible with the particular instrument.  5.3.3  Furnace Temperature Uniformity Surveys/Thermal Profiles  Furnace temperature uniformity surveys shall be performed on an annual basis and after any major furnace repair, modification or rebuild, if at all physically possible.  New furnaces shall be qualified before production use begins and survey test temperatures shall be at the minimum and maximum temperatures of the qualified operating temperature ranges.  After furnaces have been qualified for initial production use, furnaces shall be tested at the typical temperature used instead of as new furnaces.  Furnace temperature uniformity surveys/thermal profile tests in continuous furnaces and any furnaces used for fasteners shall be run at maximum rated furnace capacity or with a normal maximum production recipe size and load weight.  Furnace temperature uniformity surveys/thermal profiles in batch furnaces not used for fasteners are permitted to run with an empty furnace or with a typical production load.  Operating conditions during the test shall be representative of those used in production.  Test thermocouples and verification instruments shall be certified and traceable to NIST.  The surveys shall be done per the latest versions of ASTM A-991/991M by outside certified personnel from companies accredited under the calibration standards of ISO 17025 or internally by qualified personnel who are in compliance with ISO 17025 guidelines and who meet the qualifications and intent of the ISO 17025 standard.  Records shall be kept of training and qualifications of internal personnel.  Austenitizing or high temperature (above or equal to 1400F or 760C) furnace thermocouple survey temperatures must be within a +/-14C (+/- 25F) range along with the set point for ten (10) continuous minutes minimum (20 minutes minimum preferred and recommended) at the austenitizing temperature.  Tempering or low temperature (below 760C (1400F) furnace thermocouple survey temperatures shall be within a +/- 11C (+/- 20F) range along with the set point for twenty (20) continuous minutes minimum at the tempering temperature(s).  Temperature readings/data shall be automatically recorded at a maximum of thirty (30) second intervals.  5.3.4  Alnor or other Atmosphere Checking Equipment  Alnor or other atmosphere measuring equipment (including digital dew pointer) shall be cleaned and calibrated by an outside instrument company at least once every six (6) months.  Gas analysis equipment shall be calibrated per the recommendation of the manufacturer (typically 1 year maximum).  Zero and span gas correlation checks to a certified span gas for gas analysis accuracy are recommended daily and shall be performed and recorded weekly at a minimum.  Individuals using dew point or gas analysis equipment shall be trained according to written instructions.  Instructions provided by the manufacturer must be followed.  5.3.5  Hardness Tester Calibration and Tensile Testing  Hardness testers shall be calibrated a minimum of every six (6) months by an outside instrument service company and have a sticker attached indicating the service date and the due date for the next service.  Hardness testers shall be checked with daily use with certified standard test blocks per ASTM E-18 and the results, including block identity and tolerance, recorded and pass/fail or ok/not ok noted.  ASTM E-18 requires three usable hardness readings at a minimum be taken.  The results shall be recorded.  The main or central laboratory of a company doing tensile testing shall be accredited for tensile testing and proof load testing included on the scope of accreditation for the laboratory.  This is defined as a laboratory registered to ISO 17025 accredited for the testing denoted by a recognized outside organization such as A2LA, NVLAP (National Voluntary Lab Accreditation Program) or NADCAP (National Aerospace & Defense Contractors Accreditation Program).  If a company has multiple labs or locations that perform tensile testing, the main or central lab shall be accredited per the above.  Other labs or auxiliary locations do not have to be accredited if that company has an internal permanent employee who meets the qualifications and intent of the ISO 17025 standard and who performs on-site internal audits on an annual basis with regular proficiency testing to verify effectiveness of training.  Records shall be kept of training and qualifications of internal technical personnel associated involved with tensile and proof load training and testing.  If there is no qualified internal person available to survey the other company labs or auxiliary locations, all labs doing tensile and proof load testing shall be accredited. This is defined as a lab registered to ISO 17025 accredited for the testing denoted by a recognized outside organization such as A2LA, NVLAP (National Voluntary Lab Accreditation Program) or NADCAP (National Aerospace & Defense Contractors Accreditation Program).  5.4  Inspection requirements  5.4.1  Mechanical Hardness Tests  All work processed for FCA Group hall be checked on a lot or equivalent basis by the heat treater for heat treated hardness per the appropriate heat treat standards and part specification requirements.  Hardness checks shall include at a minimum surface hardness and core hardness.  Hardness normally is determined by the standard Brinell and Rockwell procedures.  Where part, design, necessity and/or process limitations prohibit use of these standard loads, use of other scales and conversions to lighter loads in accordance with the recommended ASTM E-18 and E-140 procedures are acceptable.  Equipment used in the past to measure hardness include machines using scales such as Rockwell, Tukon, Vickers, Knoop, Wilson Microficial, etc.  This does not preclude the use of newer machines or scales to determine the hardness equivalent to HRC as long as the equipment manufacturer and user can demonstrate proper correlations to HRC.  The equipment user shall have machines periodically maintained and calibrated.  Hardness or hardness equivalent readings for the various heat treat codes are listed in Section 6  Heat Treat Coding Requirements below.  Routine surface and core hardness checks shall not be a substitute for checking microstructure and do not satisfy the requirement to check microstructure noted in Section 5.4.2 below.  5.4.2  Microstructure  The normal quench and tempered steel microstructure shall be predominately tempered martensite.  Retained austentite could also be present unless otherwise specified as an exception or as a maximum on the print.  Checking method(s) shall also be specified.  Austempered steel parts shall be specified as austempered on the CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing/Data Sheet and shall have a predominately bainitic microstructure.  Any exceptions shall be noted on the CATIA Model/Engineering Drawing/Data Sheet.  It shall be noted that this standard is a generic heat treat standard that cannot define what is acceptable for every part, steel grade, hardenability and heat treat possibility.  If required, additional or more detailed microstructure requirements or other requirements should be defined during development of the part and noted either on the CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing/Data Sheet or in the Control Plan for the part.  Decarburization (total and/or partial) or carbon enrichment/carbon pickup may be detected by metallographic evaluation.  While a part surface hardness value may indicate a change in surface carbon, it is not normally or necessarily a sensitive enough test to accurately detect many unacceptable changes in the surface carbon level and overall microstructure condition (i.e., decarburization, carbon enrichment, excessive retained austenite, carbides, apparent grain size, etc.).  Microstructural quality for FCA Group shall be checked according to the schedule listed below with the results recorded in a log or on the job order.  The microstructural characteristics evaluated need to include base or core microstructure, surface structure, any decarburization or carbon pickup present, surface carbides (free or grain boundary), estimated percent retained austenite, etc. as required by the CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing/Data Sheet and specifications as appropriate for the heat treat process specified.  The minimum rate of microstructure checking for FCA Group parts is listed in Table 3.  ; Table 3  -  Frequency for the Checking of Microstructure; Table 3  -  Frequency for the Checking of Microstructure; Type of Equipment; Frequency of Check; Continuous Furnace; A minimum of once a shift, or once per day if the same cycle and parts are run for the entire day.; Batch Furnace – Multiple Loads; Once per day minimum; Batch Furnace – Single Load; Once for that load.; Batch Furnace – Fasteners; Each load processed.; Heat Treated and Induction Tip Hardened – Fasteners; Dependent on furnace type and load size   Routine surface or core hardness checks shall not be a substitute for checking microstructure and do not satisfy the microstructure checking requirement.  The results obtained from the checks shall be recorded in a log, on the order, with a photomicrograph, or on another preprinted form and maintained for future reference.  The results shall be noted as pass/fail or ok/not ok.  5.5  Re-process  5.5.1  Hold Areas  Rejected parts shall be adequately separated from acceptable parts and located in a designated and identified hold/reject area.  A hold/reject area log shall be maintained along with the reason for the hold and entry date along with disposition/date released.  A policy shall be in place designating the responsible person for release of material from hold status.  All material in the hold/reject area shall be identified and documented.  5.5.2  Re-processing or Re-heat Treating of Components  Parts judged as re-heat treatable and/or needing re-tempering shall have a new processing control sheet issued by qualified technical personnel denoting the necessary heat treat modifications.  Parts shall be re-heated at a temperature at least 28C (50F) above the upper critical temperature (Ac3) of the base steel composition.  If heat treating originally was done in a protective atmosphere, re-heat treating shall also be done in a protective atmosphere.  Re-tempering separately is also permitted to reduce high hardness.  All FCA CATIA/NX Model/Engineering Drawing and specification requirements shall be met.  The fact that a lot has been re-heat treated shall be noted and traceable in the records along with the original heat treat data for the same lot.  Re-heat treating shall be done according to approved procedures developed and documented by the heat treat supplier in a control plan or work instruction.  6  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  6.1  Grade Selection and General Properties of Quench and Tempered Steels – FCA Italy  A general listing of grades that have been defined by FCA Italy for use in quench and tempering are summarized in Annex C.  The content of these standards provide specific guidelines as to the steel quality requirements, hardenability, heat treatment parameters and mechanical properties associated with the steel grade.  6.2  Heat Treat Coding – FCA US***  This section is devoted to the definition of a unique coding system that was originally developed to identify the heat treatment cycle for the quench/temper process of FCA US related components.  This coding system is used on applicable component drawings and is cross referenced against this standard.  All FCA US CATIA/NX Models/Engineering Drawings/Data Sheets for parts requiring quench and tempering or austempering heat treatment carry a process description, process standard number and secondary code to indicate the prescribed heat treat processing.  A process description is first in the drawing specification.  Process descriptions are “Quench and Temper”, “Martemper”, and “Austemper”. After the process description “per” is written and then followed by the process standard number.  The process standard number for parts requiring PS.50010<S> is 50010.  The secondary coding begins with a digit number that is used immediately following the Process Standard Number 50010, safety symbol <S>, and a space to indicate preliminary heat treatment.  The PF-SAFETY<S> symbol <S> is not counted as a digit for purposes of this explanation.  A second digit using a capital letter follows the first digit, indicating the austenitizing and quenching part of the heat treatment.  The tempering stage, if any, of the heat treatment operation and the final hardness specification are designated by a two digit number in the third and fourth digit position following the capital letter.  An example of a finished code number is:  Quench and Temper per PS.50010<S> 2N12  Following is a coding chart showing the meaning of the letters and digits.  PS.50010 is still used on legacy parts, therefore a description of coding associated with PS.50010 is explained.  All FCA US CATIA Models/Engineering Drawings/Data Sheets for parts requiring PS.50010<S> heat treatment carry a process standard number and secondary coding to indicate the prescribed heat treat processing.  The process standard number for parts requiring PS.50010<S> is 1.  The secondary coding begins with a digit number that is used immediately following the Process Standard Number 1, safety symbol <S>, and the dash (–) to indicate preliminary heat treatment.  The PF-SAFETY<S> symbol <S> is not counted as a digit for purposes of this explanation.  A second digit using a capital letter follows the first digit, indicating the austenitizing and quenching part of the heat treatment.  The tempering stage, if any, of the heat treatment operation and the final hardness specification are designated by a two digit number in the third and fourth digit position following the capital letter.  An example of a finished code number is PS.50010<S>-2N12.  The coding chart below for parts requiring PS.50010<S> is applicable to parts requiring PS.50010<S> as well.  6.3  Heat Treat Coding Requirements – FCA US  Preliminary heat treating operations (first digit in secondary code number) just after PS.50010<S>.

There must be one and only one “Responsible” per task (line item) per project. Depending upon the project/program this single “Responsible” may be a different position within the department (See “or” text in the examples); A; Accountable (or Approver or Accepter): The role ultimately answerable to whether the task (line item) was completed(NOTE). Only one “A” should be assigned to a task (line item) when possible. The “Accountable” & “Responsible” roles should be members of the same department when possible.  When “Accountable” does not approve, they should work with “Responsible” to resolve open task.\\nNOTE:  Not related to approval of resources to execute the task, nor whether the task should be executed (These decisions should be listed as separate tasks prior to the task in question, if necessary); S; Supporting: Resources to be consulted, by the “Responsible”, prior to a final decision or action. Those whose opinions are sought, typically subject matter expert (SME); and with whom there is two-way communication. Input from the designated role is required.; I; Informed: Those who are kept up-to-date on progress, often only on completion of the task, decision or deliverable; and with whom there is just one-way communication.   ; Stellantis Harmonized; Document that merges xFCA & xPSA Know How (K.H.)   4  PROCEDURE DESCRIPTION Describe the roles involved and the main activities performed in the procedure; express the context in which the procedure has to be carried out and indicate information that help to read the flow-chart that describes the procedure.)   5  FLOW-CHART OF THE PROCEDURE INSERT THE FLOW-CHART HERE. Templates examples are in Annex A The flow-chart is the instrument that provides the graphic description of the procedure (sequence of the activities carried out in order to produce a determinate output, a physical product, a service, information, or a combination of them.  BEFORE designing the flow chart: Identify Input and Output of the process in order to clearly define its start and end. Define the activities, so that the assigned targets can be carried out. The single activities that build up the procedure shall be defined with the details necessary for understanding and carrying out the same procedure. The single activities shall be described in such a way that their output is clear; moreover, this output represents the input for the subsequent activity. Therefore, it is necessary to check that the Inputs and Outputs of every single activity are consistent with the individuated correlation links. Define the time sequence of the single activities. Identify the actors involved and their role.  To plan correctly Department / Roles and responsibilities in a flow-chart, especially in a complex process, it is useful to define before accountabilities by a RASI chart. Check for the existence of Standards/referenced documents that regulate the single activities. Indicate, when applicable, activity records needed to provide evidence of the execution of the same.  The flow chart can be inserted into a table whose columns are \"Who does\" (Who), \"What\" (What), \"When\" (When), \"How to\" (How), or by using a \"swim lane\" where the column headings are the various actors and the lines follow a timeline (see \\'Annex A” for examples).  NOTE:  In the column \"WHO\" for each activity shown in the flow must be indicated in a box connected with a dotted line to the activity, the departments / roles involved in detailing the level of the activities using the RASI approach.  Identify for each activity one Department / Position with primary responsibility for putting the name of the letter \"R\". Indicate with the letter \"A\" Department / role approving, with the letter \"S\" who works / supports and with the letter \"I\" who is informed.  Enter the letter that expresses the role once, by preceding it to Departments / Roles that have the same responsibilities.  In case of macro activity, indicate in the box the reference to the flow of detail in which the responsibilities are spelled out.  The column \"WHAT\" must be accounted for using the flow chart symbols and conventions listed in Annex B.  In the symbol, you must enter the minimum amount of text needed for the understanding of the activity or of the application or document type. Use the verb in the present placed at the beginning of the text.  In case of cross-reference to another section or procedure must be used the noun.  Example: \"Upgrading math\" and not \"Update math.\"  In the column \"WHEN\" references may be a defined time (e.g. September), a timeframe, a milestone, a design review or a deliverable availability (e.g. End of Step 3).  The “HOW” shall indicate the way an activity is carried out. You can maker reference to a standard or, for example, put a title in this column and use the paragraph “Description of Activities”  (see details in Section  6) to detail the activities developed in the flow chart necessary to control the process.   6  DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES (HOW)  Describe “HOW” to perform the activities in the flow-chart. There can be as many tables as the number of activities to be carried out in the procedure flow-chart, each one deployed in a different paragraph.  6.1  “Activity n” (Write the name of the specific activity)  ; Direct Responsibilities:; Direct Responsibilities:; Identify “activity n” responsible (R); Identify “activity n” responsible (R); Identify “activity n” responsible (R); Identify “activity n” responsible (R); Identify “activity n” responsible (R); Support Functions:; Support Functions:; Identify any supporting roles (A,S,I) and Departments; Identify any supporting roles (A,S,I) and Departments; Identify any supporting roles (A,S,I) and Departments; Identify any supporting roles (A,S,I) and Departments; Identify any supporting roles (A,S,I) and Departments; Input:; Input:; Identify activities/tasks that shall be considered as an input for “Activity n”; Identify activities/tasks that shall be considered as an input for “Activity n”; Identify activities/tasks that shall be considered as an input for “Activity n”; Identify activities/tasks that shall be considered as an input for “Activity n”; Identify activities/tasks that shall be considered as an input for “Activity n”; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Description of Activities:; Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Describe all the activities/tasks to be performed to carry out “activity n” (e.g. how to do “activity n”); Output:; Output:; Describe the expected output and typology of the “activity n” (that can be used as an input for the following activity); Describe the expected output and typology of the “activity n” (that can be used as an input for the following activity); Describe the expected output and typology of the “activity n” (that can be used as an input for the following activity); Describe the expected output and typology of the “activity n” (that can be used as an input for the following activity); Describe the expected output and typology of the “activity n” (that can be used as an input for the following activity); Reference Documentations:; Reference Documentations:; Indicate any specification or document needed to carry out “activity n”; Indicate any specification or document needed to carry out “activity n”; Indicate any specification or document needed to carry out “activity n”; Indicate any specification or document needed to carry out “activity n”; Indicate any specification or document needed to carry out “activity n”; Records; Document; Document; Filed by; Catalogued by; Period; ; Records; Doc number; Doc number; Owner; Name or description; Timeframe of availability; Link or database(1)  NOTE 1:  Author is responsible to verify that the link works properly.

State of Delivery- Metallurgical state chosen by the forging supplier or the bar turner on the purchase order. Its characteristics can be defined in the standard material of the grade. Reference State- Sometimes materials will be required to have specific properties in a given heat treat condition (e.g. annealed, quench and tempered, normalized, etc) called the reference state. Those heat treat conditions and properties are defined in the specific material standard. Final Product- The finished product (steel delivered in bars forms) is defined by its grade, its reference state, its delivery condition and possibly its Jominy envelope. For each grade, refer to the corresponding material standard. Certain special requirements may be indicated in addition to the technical requirements specific to each item (example: logistical requirements for bars and burdens, safety requirements for burdens...).   4  CORRELATION TO OTHER STANDARDS  B53 1040 \\tConstruction Steels in Bar Form - Technical and Administrative Requirements  B53 1046 \\tStructural Steels in Bar Form - Dimensional Requirements  B20 0250 \\tRegulated Substances  CS-9003 \\tSupplier Requirements for Vehicle and Service Parts: Restricted and Prohibited Substances  SQ.00010 \\tAdvance Quality Planning (AQP) & Production Part Approval Process (PPAP)  SQ.00017 \\tSupplier PFMEA and Control Plan Assessment    5  REGULATED SUBSTANCES & RECYCLABILITY  Steel product is to be manufactured according to acceptable methods for melting, processing and/or preparation for shipment to customers. The steel is not to be exposed to mercury or any other metal alloy that is liquid at ambient temperatures on site at the steel mill location and/or during processing.  Suppliers of steel products to STELLANTIS and its subsidiaries shall comply with all applicable laws and regulations regarding chemical substance prohibitions and restrictions. This includes STELLANTIS policies outlined in CS-9003 (Supplier Requirements for Vehicle and Service Parts: Restricted and Prohibited Substances) and B20 0250 (Regulated Substances / Materials and Restrictions of Use Within The Group PSA) as currently implemented for vehicles and parts, including service parts.   6  MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS  6.1  Radioactivity  Products shall not emit any radioactivity greater than 0,7 μSv/h (70 uREM/hr) and in no case shall be higher than 12 times background radiation.  Radiation checks must be noted on the steel cert.  When material is checked for radiation and found to be below the above requirement it is acceptable for steel mills to indicate on the steel that the scrap and steel have been checked and is free from radioactivity.  Actual readings are neither expected nor desired on the steel certification as that may cause confusion.  The mills shall maintain records detailing radiation checks including actual readings to be made available to Stellantis upon request.  6.2  Reduction ratio  Ratio of the cross section area of the continuous casting product (bloom or billet) or raw ingot casting product to the cross section area of the finished product section (bar or wire) delivered by the steelmaker.  The reduction ratio shall be a minimum of 6:1 for general applications.  Specific applications described below require greater reductions. 10:1 minimum for hubs, control arms, half-shaft tulips, final drive ring gears, and safety parts 24:1 minimum for connecting rods 40:1 minimum for semi-float axle shaft  Deviations from the listed reduction ratios requires approval from STELLANTIS Materials Engineering.  6.3  Microstructure  The structure shall correspond to that indicated for each of the different delivery conditions mentioned for each grade in its corresponding STELLANTIS material standard. It is verified by micrographic method or any other appropriate means.   6.4  Prohibited Structures  Prohibited structures include overheating, untempered martensite, or spherodized except as required by the print, specification, or purchase order.  Banding shall be within the limits of xFCA standard 50261 with a maximum allowable banding level of B2.  6.5  Grain Size  Austenitic grain size shall be 5 or finer as measured by ISO 643 or ASTM E112.  6.6  Hardenability  The upper and lower hardenability limits are defined in the material standard of the steel grade under consideration. Limits are described by upper and lower limit curves or by 3-4 points defined by a nominal hardness with tolerance.  In cases where alloys intended to be heat treated are selected based on common industry standards it is highly recommended that the suppliers purchase material to a restricted hardenability band.  This is because common industry hardenability bands are quite wide and may lead to excessive variation in heat treat results from batch to batch (mill heat to mill heat).  Hardenability for each heat shall be determined by Jominy test per ISO 642 or ASTM A255. Readings are to be taken in HRC and in cases of dispute readings shall be taken in HV30.  Calculated hardenability, using appropriate standard methods, may be used only by agreement with STELLANTIS Materials Engineering. In cases of dispute the Jominy test is considered.  The test method must be reported on the steel cert (including if calculated).  For microalloy grades, the equivalent Manganese (Mneq) is defined by the formula:  Mneq = % Mn + 0.35 x % Ni + 1.5 x % Cr+ 2 x % Mo + 0.17 x % Cu  6.7  Decarburization  The decarburized depth is defined as that of the area where carbon deficiency is observed. Decarburization can be either total (complete carbon elimination) or partial (partial carbon elimination).  The overall decarburization depth is the total decarburization depth plus the partial decarburization depth.  This decarburization is determined according to the methods defined by the PSA test method D35 1192, SAE J419, or ISO 3887.   Allowable limits:  As Rolled Products ; Diameter of product; Allowable Decarburization Depth; Allowable Decarburization Depth; Diameter of product; Total (mm); Partial (mm); 10 < D < 40; < 0.10; < 0.20; 40 < D < 110; < 0.15; < 0.30  Drawn Products ; Diameter of product; Allowable Decarburization Depth; Allowable Decarburization Depth; Diameter of product; Total (mm); Partial (mm); 10 < D < 40; < 0.05; < 0.15; 40 < D < 110; < 0.10; < 0.25   Decarburization up to 1.0% of bar diameter is allowed with approval by Stellantis Materials Engineering.  Peeled or ground products shall have no evidence of decarburization.  6.8  Cleanliness  Cleanliness is determined by microscopic examination according to ISO 4967 Method A or ASTM E45 Method A. The worst field rating on any of the test specimens shall be used to determine the results rather than the average of fields.  Exogenous inclusions are prohibited.  Unless otherwise specified on specific steel grade standard or technical specification for products, the maximum limits are as found in Table 2 below.  ; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Table 2  -  Maximum Allowable Inclusion rating; Type A(1) (sulfides); Type A(1) (sulfides); Type B (Aluminates); Type B (Aluminates); Type C (Silicates); Type C (Silicates); Type D (Globular); Type D (Globular); Thin; Heavy; Thin; Heavy; Thin; Heavy; Thin; Heavy; 3.0; 3.0; 2.0; 2.0; 2.0; 2.0; 1.5; 1.5; B+C+D thin < 4.0; B+C+D thin < 4.0; B+C+D thin < 4.0; B+C+D thin < 4.0; B+C+D thin < 4.0; B+C+D thin < 4.0  NOTE 1:  For resulfurized grades above 0.040% sulfur, the limit for type A inclusions shall be agreed upon with Stellantis Materials Engineering.    7  CHEMICAL COMPOSITION  The chemical composition of the grade is defined in the appropriate STELLANTIS material specification specific to that grade.  If no STELLANTIS specification exists for a particular grade the industry standard composition found in the appropriate EN, ISO, or ASTM specification shall be used.  Chemistry samples for final certification of heat chemistry shall be taken from the tundish during casting, preferably at halfway through the ladle pour.  7.1  Test Method  Chemistry shall be checked per the appropriate EN, ISO, ASTM, or Stellantis standard.  Carbon and sulfur may be reported on the steel cert from spectrometer results, however, in cases of dispute, test results from Leco testing shall be used.  7.2  Composition as Checked on Product  Composition checked from a sample in bar or part form shall be taken in such a way that the composition is not affected by the presence of heterogeneities such as decarburization or segregation.  The sampling shall be carried out in accordance with the requirements of standard ISO 377. The material subjected to analysis is taken from an area centered at a distance from the surface equal to 1/3 of the radius or ½ diagonal of the product.  7.3  Chemical Segregation  Chemical segregation is allowed only to the extent that the composition, both at the core and on the surface, remains within the limits imposed by the materials standards.  7.4  Deviations (Check Analysis)  Check analysis deviations are permitted to within the limits described within the appropriate EN standard by steel group (Example of the steels group for quenching and tempering: ISO 683-2) or as found in ASTM A29. Under ASTM A29 for elements not listed under table 5 (carbon steel) use limits from table 6.  7.5  Residual Elements  Small quantities of certain elements, which are not specified or required for the respective steel grade, are present in steel. These elements are considered to be residual or incidental and may include but are not limited to copper, nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and tin.  Residual elements are permitted to the below listed maximums. If copper exceeds 0.20% the Ni/Cu ratio must be 0.40 minimum.   ; Element; Max %; Cu; 0.35; Ni; 0.25; Cr; 0.20; Mo; 0.10; Sn; 0.05; Ca(1); 25 ppm; N; 110 ppm; O; 20 ppm; H; 2.5 ppm  NOTE 1:  For calcium treated steel grades  7.6  Prohibited Elements and Machining Grades  The addition of Se, Te or Pb is prohibited except in the case of improved machinability steel as defined in B53 1080 standard and shall be restricted to the limits defined in that standard.  The addition of lead to any steel must be approved by STELLANTIS Materials Engineering.  The boron content, when not defined in the composition, shall be less than 0,0007% (7 ppm).  7.7  Chemistry Confirmation at Shipping  To prevent steel mixing, product shall be verified for chemistry by chemical analysis such as XRF, IXRD or by spark testing by a qualified operator either at the inspection line (each bar) or in bundle form prior to shipping. Results shall be compared to the bundle tag to confirm it is correct.   8  PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MATERIAL  8.1  Mechanical Properties and Tests  For each steel grade, the mechanical characteristics in the reference or delivery condition, when required, are defined in the corresponding material standards, print, or purchase order. Mechanical properties are checked using specimens taken, prepared and tested according to the requirements of standard ISO 377.  8.1.1  Hardness Testing  The hardness (HB, HV, or Rockwell as specified in the material standard) is measured according to the appropriate ISO or ASTM hardness testing standard after proper preparation of the sample.  On Product in Reference State (in the ordered heat treat condition) The hardness is carried out on a (10 ± 1) mm thick transverse section treated according to the reference conditions provided for the steel grade in the material standard (e.g., as-rolled, normalized, etc.).  or mid-radius  On Product in Delivery Condition On a transverse section whose thickness is (10 ± 1) mm unless otherwise specified in the material standard, print, or purchase order. The hardness is carried out as indicated in the above section; “On Product in Reference State”.  Alternatively, on the surface of a piece of length ≈ 70 mm, after grinding deep enough to eliminate the decarburized area and provide a flat surface of sufficient width for testing  8.1.2  Tensile Testing  Test specimens are taken according to the standard ISO 377.  The test specimens have a diameter D = 10 mm, the initial length L0 between marks being equal to 50 mm (Lo = 5 * D).  The test is made according to standard ISO 6892-1 or ASTM E8.  8.1.3  Impact Testing  The reference test is the resilience test CHARPY test; the dimensions of the specimens, the method of sampling and preparation, the measuring method are defined in the test method D32 5036.  8.2  Physical Properties and Tests  Not applicable.   9  QUALITY  All material must be produced in accordance with quality system requirements such as ISO 9001:2015, or IATF 16949 Standards.  It is the responsibility of the steel maker to ensure that all requirements of this and all other appropriate standards are met. Steel defects related to cast and/or rolled product such as swelling, flakes, cracks, blowholes, pipe, excessive surface discontinuities, lack of cohesion at the core and steel chemistry mixes are not permissible in any frequency or severity.  The internal quality of the bar product shall meet the intended use and/or requirements of the finished component.  The mill shall have a clear and defined quality procedure that includes inspection, acceptance and rejection criteria, reaction plans, quarantine procedures, and continuous improvement sufficient to ensure no defective product reaches STELLANTIS or it’s suppliers.  9.1  Internal Soundness  The macrographic appearance or analysis of continuously cast billets or ingot product shall be checked by macro-etching in accordance with ASTM E381. Checks may be made in bar form but testing of billet/bloom is preferred. The mill shall have a plan and procedure that allows for each strand to be checked on a regular, rotating basis and it is preferred that the sampling includes checks at the beginning, middle, and end of heats on a rotating basis.  The severity levels shall not exceed S2 R2 C2 as defined by ASTM E381.  Baumman Sulfur printing is allowed only by permission of STELLANTIS Materials Engineering.  9.2  Surface Defects  Surface defects (cracks, seams, laps, marks, scratches) shall not exceed 1.2% of bar diameter, 2.4% for re-sulfurized grades.  For cold drawn products surface defects shall not exceed 100 microns. Bars that are turned, peeled, or polished shall have no surface defects.  9.3  Surface Inspection  All bars shall be Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL) tested (preferred) or eddy current inspected using rotating probes and shall be sufficient to detect all defects exceeding the limits in section 9.2. In addition, the test system shall have an automatic rejection capability that either marks the affected area with ink or paint for later removal or rejects the bar entirely.  Magnetic particle inspection or other inspection methods approved by Stellantis Materials Engineering is permitted only on finished product in coil form or where bar diameter does not allow for automatic inspection.  In these cases, the mill shall have a well-defined sampling, testing, and reporting practice that ensures no defects are shipped to STELLANTIS or its suppliers.  9.4  Ultrasonic Inspection  All bars shall be ultrasonically inspected using straight and angle beam transducers or a phased array system (preferred) to insure inspection of the entire bar cross-section. Ultrasonic testing results shall be capable of detecting a 0.5mm x 12.5mm side drilled hole.  Other inspection methods approved by Stellantis Materials Engineering is permitted only on finished product in coil form or where bar diameter does not allow for automatic inspection.  In these cases, the mill shall have a well-defined sampling, testing, and reporting practice that ensures no defects are shipped to STELLANTIS or its suppliers.  It is understood that bar ends, typically up to approximately 25mm of each end, are not able to be inspected.  For this reason, it is recommended that forging facilities take a drop, removing a small portion from each end of the bar.   10  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS  10.1  Hot Forging Steels  Forging steels can be ordered in the following conditions: Not softened: Condition of the bar as it is cooled from the rolling mill. The term \"as rolled\" is typically used. Softened: The state of a steel which has undergone, after rolling, a softening treatment (commonly a heating less than Ac1) to lead to a determined hardness specified in the material standard of the steel in question.  10.2  Products for Cold Forging  Not softened: Definition identical to that paragraph 10.1 Softened: Definition identical to that of paragraph 10.1 Direct cooling: The state of a product whose cooling at the output of the rolling mill (the zone is called the cooler) leads to a lamellar pearlite structure with an apparent ferritic grain size index of between 5 and 8 and a specified hardness range noted in the applicable standards. Normalized: Condition resulting from a heat treatment including austenitisation followed by a cooling leading to a lamellar perlite + ferrite structure: the transformation of the ferrite then of the perlite is done in continuous cooling (Figure 1).    Figure 1  -  Basic Theoretical Diagram for normalizing   Isothermal annealing: Condition resulting from a heat treatment including austenitisation followed by cooling to a given temperature and then maintaining it at this temperature leading to a lamellar perlite + ferrite structure: the transformation of ferrite and then of pearlite done at constant temperature (Figure 2).    Figure 2  -  Basic theoretical diagram for isothermal annealing  Spheroidized: Condition resulting from a heat treatment usually at constant temperature between Ac1 and Ac3 leading to a structure of spheroidal carbides + ferrite structure. Quenched and tempered: Condition resulting from a heat treatment including austenitisation followed by quenching and tempering to obtain the mechanical characteristics specified in the order. The structure obtained shall be that of a tempered martensite Cold Drawn: Condition resulting from a cold deformation of the product to obtain the mechanical characteristics specified in the materials standards.  10.3  General Steelmaking Requirements  Steelmaking methods and processing routes, including mold size, are approved at initial PPAP and may not be changed without notification and approval of Stellantis Materials Engineering.  It is not the intention of Stellantis to dictate the steelmaking practices for individual mills. However, certain steelmaking practices will promote higher and more consistent product quality over the lifetime of a program.  Below are practices that Stellantis deems important to consistent quality and the practices that are required or preferred.  Steelmaking- Steelmaking may be by either electric arc furnace (EAF) or basic oxygen furnace (BOF).  Other steelmaking practices must be approved by Stellantis Materials Engineering. Casting- Casting must be either by bottom pour ingot or continuous strand cast.  Other casting methods must be approved by Stellantis Materials Engineering. Unless otherwise noted on the print, specification, or purchase order steel shall be supplied at the Special Bar Quality (SBQ) level.  Merchant quality steel is not permitted under any circumstances. Scrap- Mills will have a well-defined procedure for scrap purchase, storage, selection, and use to ensure adequate quality of the final product. All scrap shall be checked for radioactivity. Deoxidation- All steels shall be fully killed. Calcium treated steels shall not be used for applications with rolling contact fatigue stress. Grain Refinement- All grain refinement additions shall be made in the ladle. Aluminum grain refinement is the preferred method.  For aluminum killed steels a minimum total aluminum content of 0.015% and a maximum total aluminum content of 0.050% is required with a preferred range of 0.025-0.040%. Optional grain refining elements such as Niobium, vanadium and titanium may also be used with STELLANTIS Materials Engineering approval only. Typical Niobium content range is 0.015-0.030% and the typical vanadium content range is 0.030-0.060%. Titanium range is 0.010%-0.025% maximum. Ladle Refining- Ladles shall be stirred during refining. Synthetic ladle slag shall be used, and compositions checked on a regular basis according to a documented plan and procedure maintained by the steel mill. Vacuum Degas- Vacuum degas is preferred but not required.  Certain applications may require vacuum degas and will be noted on the print, specification, or purchase agreement. Re-Oxidation Protection- The molten metal shall be protected against re-oxidation through various procedures such as mechanical and/or gaseous shrouding. Fully submerged ceramic shrouding with gas protected seals is preferred for transfer from ladle to tundish and tundish to mold. Nozzle Clogging- Ladle non-free opens or tundish nozzle clogging events shall be tracked and the mill will have a procedure to ensure any resulting sub-standard quality product is not shipped to Stellantis or its suppliers. Tundish Practice- The mill will utilize a tundish with sufficient capacity to preclude vortexing and provide adequate residence time for the flotation of inclusions/oxides. Chemical additions made to the tundish are prohibited.  The use of impact pads, dams, weirs, baffles, and other flow control devices to promote inclusion flotation are encouraged. Superheat- Superheat shall be controlled and temperatures shall be measured and recorded in the tundish at a minimum frequency of beginning, middle, and end of casting of the heat.  High superheats should be avoided, and the mill should aim to consistently have low superheats.  Preferred maximum superheat is 95oF (35oC). Mold Level Control- The mill shall ensure consistent mold level control of molten steel. Automatic mold level control is preferred. Casting parameters- Casting temperature, stopper-rod or slide gate position, mold level, mold oscillation, and casting speed shall be monitored and recorded during casting. It is preferred that secondary cooling parameters are also recorded. Mold Additions- The addition of alloying or grain refining elements to the mold are strictly prohibited. The preferred chemical addition method is to have all the chemistry/chemical additions made in the ladle refining furnace or ladle metallurgy station prior to tapping the molten steel into the tundish. In the cases where mill are using centrifugal casting processes mold additions may be made with approval from Stellantis Materials Engineering. Secondary Cooling- solidification processes shall be controlled to prevent excessive segregation, banding, inclusions, pipe, etc. that will adversely affect the use of the finished component in manufacturing operations or functional requirements. Electromagnetic Stirring (EMS)- Electromagnetic stirring in the mold is not required but highly preferred.  Additional, secondary stirring and/or soft reduction is preferred. Certain applications may require EMS and will be noted on the print, specification, or purchase agreement. Re-heating- Billet re-heating furnaces will preferably have a walking beam hearth, multi-zone, and sufficient temperature control to ensure adequate and uniform heating of blooms/billets without overheating. Heat Lot Traceability- All blooms, billets, bars, tube or rod in either cut lengths or coil shall retain a unique heat identification for traceability purposes. The mill shall have adequate procedures to ensure heat mixing does not occur including reaction plans in the event of mixing. Cold Shearing- When cold shearing of the steel bar product is required, a microstructure and/or hardness shall be provided that does not contribute to the formation of cracks/tears that could render the material unsuitable for subsequent hot or cold forming. Bar sawing is preferred.  Table 3 below provides recommendations for cold shearing limitations.   ; Table 3  -  Recommended Cold Shearing Limitations for Hot Rolled Carbon and Alloy Steel Bar or Equivalent Cross Sectional Area; Table 3  -  Recommended Cold Shearing Limitations for Hot Rolled Carbon and Alloy Steel Bar or Equivalent Cross Sectional Area; Table 3  -  Recommended Cold Shearing Limitations for Hot Rolled Carbon and Alloy Steel Bar or Equivalent Cross Sectional Area; Steel Designation; Carbon Content (Weight Percent); Diameter (Maximum); Not Annealed; Not Annealed; Not Annealed; Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; Less than 0.35 incl.; 90 mm (3.5 inch); Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; 0.40 – 0.45 incl.; 75 mm (3.0 inch); Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; 0.45 – 0.50 incl.; 63.5 mm (2.5 inch); Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; 0.50 – 0.55 incl.; 50 mm (2.0 inch); Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; 0.55 – 0.75 incl.; 40 mm (1.5 inch); Carbon, Resulfurized and Resulfurized – Rephosphorized Grades with less than 1.00% Mn; 0.75 – 1.00incl; 25 mm (1.0 inch); Manganese – Chrome Grades; Less than 0.25 incl.; 100 mm (4.0 inch); Chrome – Molybdenum Grades; Less than 0.25 incl.; 100 mm (4.0 inch); Nickel – Chrome – Molybdenum\\nGrades; Less than 0.25 incl.; 100 mm (4.0 inch); Annealed for Cold Shearing; Annealed for Cold Shearing; Annealed for Cold Shearing; All grades cited above; Less than 0.25 incl.; 125 mm (5.0 inch); For all other steel grades, carbon content and diameters, reference Tables 10.3 (not annealed), 10.4 (annealed) and 10.5 (metric equivalents) in the ISS/AME/AISI Steel Bar Product Guidelines (available from AISI at http://www.autosteel.org); For all other steel grades, carbon content and diameters, reference Tables 10.3 (not annealed), 10.4 (annealed) and 10.5 (metric equivalents) in the ISS/AME/AISI Steel Bar Product Guidelines (available from AISI at http://www.autosteel.org); For all other steel grades, carbon content and diameters, reference Tables 10.3 (not annealed), 10.4 (annealed) and 10.5 (metric equivalents) in the ISS/AME/AISI Steel Bar Product Guidelines (available from AISI at http://www.autosteel.org)   11  ADDITIONAL CONTACTS  ; Name / Region; email; Role   12  RELEASE AND REVISIONS  ; Change level; Date; Description of change; -; 04-OCT-2022; Initial release.\\nThis document replaces MS.90028<S> and B53 1043\\nDocInfo reference 01446_22_00467; A; 19-JUL-2023; Updated to new format\\nSection 7.4- added clarification for use of ASTM A29 tables\\nSection 7.5- corrected typos in table and added Ni/Cu ratio for steels with 0.20% or higher copper.

The supplier must provide the carbon footprint of the material upon request.   6  MATERIAL CHARACTERISTICS  6.1  Steel Types - bare and substrate for coated products  6.1.1  Mild Steels  Mild steels are characterized by low yield strength and high ductility and are especially suited for the production of complex parts.  They are produced as aluminum killed non-IF grades or as IF grades.  Soft IF grades have an excellent formability, show very low carbon and nitrogen contents, and are stabilized by the addition of titanium and/or niobium. In the same coil, a variation in grain size between the core and the surface of ≥ 2 is not permitted.(ASTM E112 or ISO 643).  6.1.2  High Strength IF-Steels (IF)  High Strength IF-steels have very low contents of carbon and nitrogen and are stabilized by the addition of titanium and/or niobium.  As a consequence, these steels show a nearly unlimited suitability for storage.  Their higher strength is achieved by solid solution hardening with adding manganese, phosphorus and/or silicon.  A higher work-hardening, no pronounced yield point, high elongation and r values result in an excellent formability.  6.1.3  Bake Hardenable Steels (BH)  The higher strength of bake hardenable steels is achieved by solid solution hardening adding manganese, phosphorus and silicon.  The dissolved carbon in the lattice results in a defined increase in yield strength after heat cycles that usually occur in automotive paint processes (e.g. 170 °C, 20 minutes).  Bake hardening index should be determined per EN 10325.  Bake hardening effect improves the dent resistance for exposed outer panels.  Since this shift in the mechanical properties (yield strength, elongation, n-value) is a time and temperature driven process, the suitability for storage of these steels is limited.   6.1.4  High Strength Low Alloy Steels (HSLA)  Micro-alloyed Steels achieve their high strength through alloy additions of niobium, titanium, and vanadium.  Those alloying elements can be added either alone or in combination.  Alternatively, carbon-manganese alloying concepts in combination with grain refinement can be used.  Structure shall be ferritic with evenly distributed fine grains. The grains shall not have preferential orientation. The size of the grains, determined as per Standard UNI EN ISO 643, is to be 10 or finer. Size 9 grains are allowed only in percentages less than 10 %. Type A inclusions shall not exceed index I=1 (ASTM E45 method A, ISO4967).  6.1.5  Fine Grain Low Alloy Steels (MC)  The fine grain microstructure of these micro-alloyed steels is achieved by finely dispersed precipitations (mostly carbides and/or nitrides) in combination with final rolling at a certain temperature range, the thermo-mechanical rolling.  Due to their fine grained structure, small grain size low alloyed steels show high fatigue strength.  6.1.6  Dual Phase Steels (DP)  The microstructure of dual phase steels consists of a soft ferrite matrix with a dispersed mainly martensitic phase.  At a given high tensile strength dual phase steels show a low yield ratio (YS/UTS) and a strong work hardening capacity.  Therefore, dual phase steels are especially suited for forming operations with high stretching portions.  6.1.7  TRIP Steels (TR & TB)  TRIP (Transformation Induced Plasticity) or retained austenite steels have a fine-grained ferritic-bainitic microstructure with embedded retained austenite.  Small portions of martensite can also be present.  During plastic deformation retained austenite transforms to martensite and leads to a strong work hardening (TRIP effect).  High tensile strengths with high values of the uniform elongation can be achieved.  The combination of work and bake hardening results in high component strengths.  TRIP steels are suited for stretch forming and deep drawing where high press and blank-holder forces and a strong springback effect have to be considered.  TRIP steels are also available with fine bainitic matrix in place of ferrite, and are termed as TRIP assisted Bainitic (TB) steels.  These steels show better performance with respect to regular TRIP, a higher YS and UTS due to bainitic-ferritic matrix and higher ductility due to stable retained austenite. This microstructure also provides better stretch flangeability and bending behaviour.  The TRIP-Bainitic cold rolled steel grades, contain significant amounts of austenite in their microstructure. These steel grades when supplied with a zinc coating (GI, EG, GA) will require additional development for arc, laser and spot welding processes. Application engineers must receive approval from Materials Engineering when specifying an arc or laser welding process for joints using a combination of these materials and coatings.  6.1.8  Ferritic-Bainitic Steels (FB)  Ferritic-bainitic steels are characterized by a matrix of ferrite or strengthened ferrite containing bainite or strengthened bainite.  The high strength of the matrix is caused by grain refinement, precipitation of micro-alloying elements and a high dislocation density.   6.1.9  Multiphase Steel (MP)  Multiphase phase steels are characterized by a multiphase microstructure containing mostly a ferritic-bainitic matrix whereas martensite, tempered martensite, retained austenite and pearlite can be present as additional phases.  The extremely fine-grained microstructure is generated by retarded recrystallization or precipitation of micro-alloying elements.  Compared to dual phase steels they show a higher yield ratio, lower work hardenability and good hole expansion ratios.  6.1.10  Martensitic Steels (MT)  Martensitic steels have a mainly martensitic microstructure with small amounts of ferrite and/or bainite and thus a very high strength.  Drawability is limited; these steel grades are more suited for bending processes like roll forming.  6.2  Coating Types  6.2.1  Electrogalvanized Coating (EG)  Zinc coating with a zinc content of at least 99.9 % by mass electrolytically applied in a continuous coating process on a suitable prepared steel surface. Refer to PS.50061, for the coating process.  6.2.2  Electrogalvanized Zinc-Nickel Coating (ZN)  Electrogalvanized zinc-nickel alloy coating with a Nickel content from 9 % to 13 % by mass.

Refer to PS.50061 for the coating process.  6.2.4  Hot Dip Coating with Zinc-Iron Alloy (Galvannealed, GA)  This zinc-iron alloy coating is generated by immersing the prepared strip in a molten bath containing a zinc content of at least 99 % and a subsequent annealing.  At the same time iron diffuses into the zinc layer.  The bulk iron content of unexposed zinc-iron alloy coatings produced by hot-dip (GA) process shall be 7 to 16 weight %.  The bulk iron content of critical exposed hot-dip (GA) zinc-iron alloy coating shall be 7 to 14 weight %.  Refer to PS.50061 for the coating process.   6.2.5  Hot Dip Aluminum-Silicon Coating (AS)  This coating shall be applied through continuous hot dip process using molten aluminum-silicon bath.  The bulk silicon content in the coating shall be 8 % - 11 %.  Refer to PS.50026 for exFCA plants and B53 3270 for exPSA plants for the coating process.  6.2.6  Zinc-Magnesium Coating (ZM)  This coating shall be applied through continuous hot dip process using molten zinc-magnesium-aluminium bath. For the ZM unexposed components the content of Al shall be from 1.0% to 3.0% and Mg from 1.0 to 2.8% For the ZM exposed components the content of Al shall be from 1.0 % to 3.0% and of Mg from 1.0% to 2.0%.  Refer to PS.50061.  6.2.7  Zinc-Magnesium Coating high composition (ZH)  This coating shall be applied through continuous hot dip process using molten zinc-magnesium-aluminium bath.

Process involves zinc vapor production in a vapor generator through thermal activation and subsequently deposited through a wide array jet to achieve a very high deposition rate to produce a high corrosion performance product. Coating is especially suited for AHSS sheet since this process involves much lower temperatures and no exposure to hydrogen.  Refer to PS.50061 for coating process.  6.3  Coating Mass  Coating mass for coated steel sheets shall be determined in accordance with ISO 1460.

Tests shall be performed per LP. 7M001 using a Type 1 sample (50 mm gage length, ASTM type), a Type 2 sample (80 mm gage length, DIN type), Iso Type 3 (50 mm gage length) as required by the purchaser.  For the EMEA region, hot rolled material (typical material with more than 1.8 mm of thickness), with a thickness > 3 mm, the tests shall be performed using the proportional specimen with L0 = 5.65 √S0 (S0: specimen cross-sectional area) to determine the elongation A.  The testing direction shall be longitudinal unless otherwise specified elsewhere in this document.  The yield strength shall be measured at 0.2 % offset.  If yield point elongation is present, the lower yield strength shall be used.  Plastic strain ratio r shall be determined at 20 % strain per ISO 10113.  Strain hardening exponent n for all but the DP grades shall be determined at 10 to 20 % strain per ISO 10275.  For DP grades, n shall be determined at 4 to 6 % strain, as well as at 10% to UE (uniform elongation).  Elongation is shown for both the ASTM 50 mm and DIN 80 mm gauge lengths.  For coated sheet steel products – coating shall not be removed from the tensile specimen before testing and no compensation shall be made to the strength of the steel based on coating thickness.  Bake hardenable steels, dual phase steels and TRIP steels shall have yield strength increases due to work hardening from strain imparted during forming and an additional strengthening increment that occurs during the paint-baking process. This increase in yield strength is measured as BH2 index following EN 10325.   Hole Expansion Index (HEI) shall be measured following ISO-6630 and for more detail Stellantis lab procedure LP.7M047. For purpose of analysis of the strength of the stamped component, in many cases it is not possible to conduct standard tensile test due to lack of flat surface area for specimen preparation. In such cases either the surface hardness or bulk hardness can be used for estimation of the material strength.  ; Table 13  -  Mechanical Properties in Transverse Direction for CR Mild Steel; Table 13  -  Mechanical Properties in Transverse Direction for CR Mild Steel;

When the steel is used in welded applications, welding procedures shall be suitable for the steel chemistry and intended service. When welding is performed on a particular part made from sheet steels covered in this standard, it is the responsibility of the steel supplier, the part manufacturer, and the welder of the parts (assembly) to control both the chemical composition of the steel used and the welding process to ensure continuing compatibility with the appropriate welding process employed.  Basic material chemistry, steel thickness, and welding processes and parameters used are major factors affecting weldability.  Engineering standards cannot cover all possible variables and circumstances for every application.  Additional restrictions and controls in manufacturing may be necessary by any or all parties concerned to produce satisfactory parts and welds.  10.1.1  Application of Laser Welding  The ability to apply laser lap or butt welds with requisite quality depends upon the specific combination of materials and material coatings intended for joining. All intended applications of laser welding shall be reviewed in detail with the Stellantis Welding team to determine an appropriate course of evaluation prior to any engineering release of laser welding.  This requirement applies to all materials detailed in this standard.  10.2  Surface Texture and Finish- to be discussed  The steel surface will fall under one of the three categories, Exposed (E), Unexposed (U), or Bumper quality (B).  Steel should be free from burrs that exceed height of more than 10% of the sheet metal thickness.  For surface roughness measurement methods and requirements refer to standard  MS.50147.   10.2.1  Unexposed (U)  Material surface shall be free of any major mill defects such as lamination, pinchers, scale, scabs, seams, laps, holes, slivers, gouges, scratches or any other similar defect that may damage the substrate. Included with major mill defects will be any coating defect that can reduce the corrosion performance of the material.  These defects could be bare spots, unalloyed edges or any mill condition that compromises coating adhesion. Steel should be free from burrs and foreign material introduced during subsequent processing steps prior to stamping.  Special surface conditions can be pre negotiated and noted on the metal specification and Purchase order.  10.2.2  Exposed (E)  Material surface shall be free of defects that might affect the uniform appearance of quality paint or an electrolytic coating (electro-deposited primer, cathodic e-coat).  Steel should be free from burrs and foreign material introduced during subsequent processing steps prior to stamping.  10.2.3  Bumper Quality (B)  Stamped steel surfaces that are decorative plated or painted must be capable of meeting part appearance requirements as defined by a master sample. Decorative plated bumpers shall meet the specified standard as agreed between purchaser and supplier. Post-forming metal finishing may be used on selected surfaces to meet appearance requirements for decorative bumpers.  Surface shall be free of pits, laminations, inclusions, pickups, or other defects which may affect appearance, durability, or function, once plated or painted and as agreed between supplier and purchaser.  Bumper quality steel supplied to this standard shall utilize a minimum 0.5% temper or skin pass to sufficiently eliminate stretcher strain (Lüders Lines) in the formed bumper product. Use of bumper quality steel does not necessarily preclude the need for post-forming and pre-plating/painting metal finish in local areas to meet appearance requirements.  Chemical composition limits covered in Section 7 are relaxed for Mn and P content when the following sheet steel grades are supplied with Bumper Quality (B) surface requirements:  LAC240Y320T 0.85% max Mn and 0.14% max P LAC270Y340T 1.3% max Mn and 0.14% max P LAC300Y360T 1.3% max Mn and 0.14% max P LAC340Y410T 1.5% max Mn and 0.04% max P  Surface Finish for Sheet Steel for Plated Bumpers  Decorative plated bumpers shall follow requirements of standard PS.50019.  Mill Finish Blanks - All temper rolled steel supplied under this specification shall have the following surface finish: Ra 0.9 microns (35 micro in) maximum, and Rm 80 microns (300 micro in) maximum.  Flat Polished Blanks - Steel blanks shall be finished using a combination dry and wet abrasive belt sequence to Ra 0.3 microns (12 micro in) maximum and Rm 3 microns (118 micro in) maximum, prior to forming. To allow for metal removal in flat polishing, the upper tolerance limit of thickness per PS.50009 is increased by 0.07 mm.   Surface Finish for Sheet Steel for Painted Bumpers  Painted bumpers shall be processed to meet specification for Cathodic Epoxy Electro-coat MS.90124 followed by powder coat per MS-PE-16-2. Cold rolled or hot rolled steel shall be capable of being painted to meet finished part quality requirements.  The surface finish of sheet steel to be used for painted bumpers should have Ra 1.4 microns (55 micro-inch) maximum, and Rm 80 microns (300 micro-inch) maximum. For zinc coated steel refer to Section 6.2 for requirements on, but not limited to, coating composition, coating mass, and coating adhesion.  See Section 6.4 for nomenclature and material call out for use on drawings and engineering documents.  10.3  Cleanability, Phosphateability, and Paint Compatibility.  Unless specified otherwise, the finished uncoated as well as coated sheet or strip shall be coated on all sides with a Stellantis approved mill oil. The material has to be compatible with the Stellantis painting lines.  10.4  Adhesive Compatibility  For bonded applications, the surfaces of the coated and uncoated flat products furnished to this specification shall be capable of being adhered with the respective adhesives specified for the particular application.   11  APPROVED SOURCE LIST Materials covered by this standard shall only be purchased from those source(s) that are approved by Materials Engineering and documented in SD.00013/MXP_CEB00_0016.  These documents may be restricted and are not shared with suppliers.

End of Annex E      Annex F (Informative) Standard Deviation process approval         Standard Deviation Definition - Project unique need to deviate from the standard and Deviation need should be related to technical, commercial or regional specific.  Steel Usage Technical (SUT) Committee approval – Submit the standard deviation request approval to SUT (BCI N-2 & Body N-3 level) and it is mandatory approval before the next step in the approval process. Refer to Global PMO referent of your region for any assistance.  Deviation request option (This step can be skipped if the deviation access already exists) -  Submit to beSTandard group for the “deviation request option” access in beSTandard via email - antoniodanilo.casella@stellantis.com or angelica.fabre@stellantis.com. Every region need to use “Deviation FCA Italy” option for any standard deviation (EPER working on updating the label in English. For xP users, for beSTandard access follow the link).                   Material group approval – Submit the standard deviation request approval to Materials & Sustainability Engineering group as “Responsible” in the request through beSTandard “Deviation FCA Italy” (EPER working on updating the label in English) with relevant standard deviation information including SUT committee approval (email with meeting minutes).
