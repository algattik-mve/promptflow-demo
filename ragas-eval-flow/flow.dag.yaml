  question:
    type: string
    default: For which usages are the two valve engines still produced in the US?
  answer:
    type: string
    default: Based on the given context, the two valve engines are widely used in
      the world, in the US especially for agriculture, marine and industrial
      purposes.
  context:
    type: string
    default: "Content: Most modern highly refined four cycle diesel engines today,
      in the displacement range from 10 to 16 liters, run at about 2000 rpm with
      average piston speeds of about 2000 feet per minute. Most of the engines
      are used for over-the-highway longdistance hauling (class 8 trucks) with
      power outputs up to 400 to 450 BHP. At least in the United States, the
      engines utilize four-valve-per-cylinder designs. Some of these engines are
      also used for industrial, marine and construction equipment. Other than
      some much larger military industrial, generating and marine engines which
      have used four valves per cylinders practically since the end of World War
      II, these newer American engines are the only four-valve-per-cylinder
      large diesels in the world today, and are produced in relatively small
      numbers by only about five U.S. companies. In the rest of the industrial
      world (Europe and Japan) as well as in the U.S. for all other applications
      (class 7 and smaller trucks, agricultural, marine, industrial, buses,
      etc.) the bulk of production is based in old two valve technology. The
      situation is mostly due to the multiplicity of manufacturers (dozens) and
      the myriad of uses (as many as three to four thousand different models
      being available), as well as the very high costs of development, tooling
      and manufacturing new designs for such stratified markets. \\nSource:

  ground_truth:
    type: string
    default: Two valve engines are produced for the US market to be used in class 7
      and smaller trucks, agricultural, marine, industrial, buses, etc.
